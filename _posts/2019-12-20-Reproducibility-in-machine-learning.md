This technical blog series titled "Reproducibility in Machine Learning" is going to be divided into three parts:
1. Reproducibility in Machine Learning - Research and Industry
2. Realizing reproducible Machine Learning - with Tensorflow 
3. End-to-end reproducible Machine Learning pipelines on Kubernetes


## Part 1: Reproducibility in Machine Learning - Research and Industry

In [Part 1], the objective will be discuss importance of reproducibility in machine learning. It will also cover where both research and industry are stands in writing reproducible ML. This blog can be accessed [here][Part 1].

## Part 2: Realizing reproducible Machine Learning - with Tensorflow 

The focus of [Part 2] - **realizing reproducible Machine Learning - with Tensorflow** will be writing reproducible machine learning code. [Tensorflow][tensorflow] is being used as machine learning stack for demonstration purposes. This blog can be accessed [here][Part 2]. 

## Part 3: End-to-end reproducible Machine Learning pipelines on Kubernetes

[Part 3] is all about realizing end-to-end machine learning pipelines on [kubernetes][k8s]. This blog can be accessed [here][Part 3].
