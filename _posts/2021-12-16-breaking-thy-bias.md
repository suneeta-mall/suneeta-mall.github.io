### Poem

<center>*Fearless and Forward: breaking thy bias*</center>
<center><br></center>
<center>The strengths and weaknesses, </center>
<center>The characters and charismatics,</center>
<center>The appearances and aspirations, </center>
<center>Not all are created equal,</center>
<center><br></center>
<center>The abundance of variations,</center>
<center>The power of diversity, </center>
<center>The strength of unity,</center>
<center>How do we fail to see? </center>
<center><br></center>
<center>Perhaps blinded by the prior beliefs,</center>
<center>So afraid of change, of that glass ceiling</center>
<center>Subsumed by delusion, </center>
<center>Doused in false assurances </center>
<center><br></center>
<center>Perhaps too scared to walk the line,</center>
<center>Between old faith and curiosity; </center>
<center>Experience and epiphany;  </center>
<center>Ambition and passion; </center>
<center>Arrogance and conviction;</center>
<center>Bias and openness;  </center>
<center><br></center>
<center>Beyond this line lies an open world,</center>
<center>Of shared responsibility and collective strengths, </center>
<center>Of humbled weakness and fearless world.</center>
<center><br></center>
<center>A world of colors, of joys,</center>
<center>Of strengths, of understanding </center>
<center>Of supporting and creating, </center>
<center>A fearless forward better world.</center>
<center><br></center>
<center>Why would not you,</center>
<center>Walk thy line? </center>
<center>Why would not you,</center>
<center>Break thy bias?</center>
<center><br></center>
