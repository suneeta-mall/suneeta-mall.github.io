title: About Me 
---

As Head of AI Engineering at [harrison.ai](https://harrison.ai/), I lead teams developing breakthrough AI solutions that transform healthcare delivery across radiology and pathology. My work has created impact at scale—from pioneering Harrison.rad.1 (radiology's first foundation model) to deploying AI systems serving millions of patients in over 1,000 healthcare facilities worldwide.

I believe that "Transforming a formidable vision into reality by serving the team with empathy, courage, and action is leadership." This philosophy guides my approach to solving complex challenges through collaborative innovation. Whether developing regulatory-cleared medical AI solutions, authoring ["Deep Learning at Scale" (O'Reilly)](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/8214), or mentoring the next generation of technologists, I remain focused on creating technology that genuinely improves lives.

My career spans pioneering research, enterprise AI scaling at Nearmap, and now healthcare transformation—all united by a commitment to technical excellence, responsible innovation, and building diverse teams that challenge each other toward better outcomes.
