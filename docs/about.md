title: About Me 
---

Suneeta is passionate about solving real-world problems with engineering, data, science, and machine learning. She's a PhD in applied science with a computer science and engineering background. She has extensive distributed, scalable computing and machine learning experience from IBM Software Labs, Expedita, USyd, Nearmap and more recently harrison.ai.

She currently leads the AI Engineering division of [harrison.ai](https://harrison.ai/), a clinician-led artificial intelligence medical technology company tackling some of the biggest issues in healthcare causing inequitable diagnosis today.

She believes in lifelong learning and is passionate about knowledge sharing. She is also an author for [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/8214) and writes [technical blogs](https://suneeta-mall.github.io/) in her spare time.
