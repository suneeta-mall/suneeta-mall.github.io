## Book Release Announcements 

I am thrilled to announce the release of "Deep Learning at Scale: At the Intersection of Hardware, Software, and Data" - an O'Reilly Book"! I have been working on this project for over 2 years with my team at O'Reilly media.

### Deep Learning at Scale - An O'Reilly Book

> "Deep Learning at Scale: At the Intersection of Hardware, Software, and Data" (O'Reilly) by Suneeta Mall illustrates complex concepts of full stack deep learning and reinforces them through hands-on exercises to arm you with tools and techniques to scale your project. A scaling effort is only beneficial when it's effective and efficient. To that end, this guide explains the intricate concepts and techniques that will help you scale effectively and efficiently.
