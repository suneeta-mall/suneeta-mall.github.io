# To all the Daminis

## The Poem

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0; font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
Can’t believe you had to go through this  
Can’t believe someone did this to you
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
Took a part of you away  
Shattering your soul into pieces
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
As my heart melts away  
I have very less to say  
Not that I am callous  
But hey! no false promises
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
As I read about you  
I feel proud of you  
On your courage  
And your strength
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
It’s not just you Damini  
Atrocities are such  
we are a land of Daminis  
Some faded, some long forgotten
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
I ain’t know, who to blame  
So I blame myself  
For a being a part of community  
Who could not keep you safe
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
I ain’t no feminist, but I do have soul  
For I am female  
And I know how you feel  
I know how you feel
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
As millions of hearts reach out to you  
To share your pain & your agony  
All I can offer you is pray  
Love & Support
</div>

</div>
