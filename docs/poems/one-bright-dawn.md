# One Bright Dawn

<center>The bell has rung, filling me in with a flawless zing,</center>
<center>A bell, that sings, mystic rings,</center>
<center>Of twitter and chime,</center>
<center>In perfect rhyme,</center>
<center><br></center>
<center>The gust of breeze, in its gentle feel,</center>
<center>Touched me deep, inside within,</center>
<center>Soft and sweet, lukewarm feel,</center>
<center>Perfect pamper, as I feel,</center>
<center><br></center>
<center>The bright shining dawn rays,</center>
<center>Dancing at my door ways,</center>
<center>Winking, smiling, teasing, luring,</center>
<center>In all its magnanimous ways,</center>
<center><br></center>
<center>And thatâ€™s when I open my eyes,</center>
<center>Welcoming new days, arms open wide,</center>
<center>Governed by the aura, defined by the angles of time,</center>
<center>With hopes high mountains, in energy of fountains,</center>
<center><br></center>
<center>I there by call it, utopian sunshine!</center>
