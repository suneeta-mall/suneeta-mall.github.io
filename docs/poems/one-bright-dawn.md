# One Bright Dawn

## The Poem

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0; font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
The bell has rung, filling me in with a flawless zing,  
A bell, that sings, mystic rings,  
Of twitter and chime,  
In perfect rhyme,
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
The gust of breeze, in its gentle feel,  
Touched me deep, inside within,  
Soft and sweet, lukewarm feel,  
Perfect pamper, as I feel,
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
The bright shining dawn rays,  
Dancing at my door ways,  
Winking, smiling, teasing, luring,  
In all its magnanimous ways,
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
And that's when I open my eyes,  
Welcoming new days, arms open wide,  
Governed by the aura, defined by the angles of time,  
With hopes high mountains, in energy of fountains,
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
<span style="font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50;">I there by call it, utopian sunshine!</span>
</div>

</div>

## Inspiration

An beautiful dawn filled with hope!
