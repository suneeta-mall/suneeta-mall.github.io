# Fearless and Forward - breaking thy bias

## The Poem

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0; font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Fearless and Forward: breaking thy bias</span>

The strengths and weaknesses,  
The characters and charismatics,  
The appearances and aspirations,  
Not all are created equal,
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
The abundance of variations,  
The power of diversity,  
The strength of unity,  
How do we fail to see?
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
Perhaps blinded by the prior beliefs,  
So afraid of change, of that glass ceiling  
Subsumed by delusion,  
Doused in false assurances
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
Perhaps too scared to walk the line,  
Between old faith and curiosity;  
Experience and epiphany;  
Ambition and passion;  
Arrogance and conviction;  
Bias and openness;
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
Beyond this line lies an open world,  
Of shared responsibility and collective strengths,  
Of humbled weakness and fearless world.
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
A world of colors, of joys,  
Of strengths, of understanding  
Of supporting and creating,  
A fearless forward better world.
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
Why would not you,  
Walk thy line?  
Why would not you,  
Break thy bias?
</div>

</div>

## Inspiration

Internation Women's day 2022 campaign theme #BreakTheBias.

Poem also draws inspiration from [Heinrich Rohrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Rohrer) quote:
> Science means constantly walking a tightrope between blind faith and curiosity; between expertise and creativity; between bias and openness; between experience and epiphany; between ambition and passion; and between arrogance and conviction - in short, between an old today and a new tomorrow.
