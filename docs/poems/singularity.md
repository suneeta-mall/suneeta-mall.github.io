# Singularity!


<center>Whispers of apprehension,</center>
<center>Clouding your judgement,</center>
<center>Spiralling you down,</center>
<center>Into a black hole of mess!</center>

<center>You're ready to rise, but you hesitate,</center>
<center>Questions and fear, you second-guess fate.</center>
<center>You may not know it all,</center>
<center>But you have got it all,</center>

<center>Believe it! Feel it!</center>
<center>The power’s inside!</center>
<center>Believe it! Feel it!</center>
<center>Without it, you’re denied!</center>

<center>Wear your doubts, Own your fears,</center>
<center>Like shiny armours, stronger each year</center>
<center>Enough is enough, and you know it’s right!</center>
<center>Show up now, it’ll be all right!</center>

<center>"Fake it till you make it?" — that's just a lie,</center>
<center>A hollow thought, no reason why.</center>
<center>Where’s your truth, your inner gleam?</center>
<center>Your singularity?</center>

<center>Believe it! Feel it! Find it all, within!</center>
<center>Come hell or high, You will do all right!</center>
<center>Feel that faith, you are nothing without it!</center>
<center>Show up now, it’ll be all right!</center>

<center>Enough is enough!</center>
<center>Wear your doubts,</center>
<center>Own your fears,</center>
<center>Face the horizon, no more tears.</center>

<center>The wait is over!</center>
<center>It’s time to rise!</center>
<center>[emphasis] Like a phoenix! through the skies,</center>
<center>With your fears, no more your tears.</center>

<center>Gather the ashes, gather the flames,</center>
<center>Your ambition calls your name.</center>
<center>It’s now or never, so face your fear,</center>
<center>Let your creed burn, bright and clear!</center>

<center>Feel it, believe it, The strength’s within!</center>
<center>Come hell or high,  you’ll take it in stride!</center>

<center>Wear your doubts, Own your fears,</center>
<center>Channel that fire, feel it sear!</center>
<center>Melt it down, let yourself shine,</center>
<center>This is your moment—pure gold, divine!</center>

<center>Feel it! Believe it!</center>
<center>Find it all, within!</center>

<center>Step by step, on the grind,</center>
<center>With every move, strength you’ll find.</center>
<center>Assaying, slaying, climbing high,</center>
<center>Chasing the light, through the endless sky!</center>

<center>Embrace your qualms, Turn your fear to your might,</center>
<center>You are the black hole, With the photonic light!</center>

<center>Channel your power, and bring it to light.</center>
<center>Feel it! Believe it!  The strength inside!</center>

<center>Wear your doubts, Own your fears,</center>
<center>Face the horizon, beyond the fears.</center>

<center>Through highs and lows, through joy and sad.</center>
<center>Your power sways 'tween loss and gain,</center>
<center>Find your balance, own your light,</center>
<center>Now go ahead, and shine so bright!</center>

<center>Feel it! Believe it!</center>
<center>Find your way within!</center>

<center>Wear those doubts, Own those fears,</center>
<center>Channel that fire, feel it sear!</center>
<center>Melt it down, refine your soul,</center>
<center>This is you—turn it into gold!</center>

<center>Rise up now, it’s gonna be fine!</center>
<center>Like a phoenix! through the skies,</center>
