## The Poem

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0; font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
My little butterfly  
You are the apple of my eyes  
Seeing you brightly shine  
My heart melts to shiny slime
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
A beautiful day it is today,  
You starting your schooling  
With million hopes and dreams  
I long to see you shine!
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
The journey you start today, my little girl  
You see, itâ€™s about a magical land  
You can build, create, innovate!  
But you can also destroy, and eliminate!
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
Its a journey of empowerment  
Of empathy, confidence, and courage  
Your perseverance is the wand, and  
Your knowledge thy spell
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
So my little bunny,  
With a cheeky little grin,  
Let the magic unfold  
Let the knowledge begin
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
To take you to infinite possibilities  
Of unicorns, fairies, glitters, and utopia!  
Of tingle and tinker  
Of awe and sympathy
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
All I ask of you is to be kind,  
Both to others and to yourself  
And to never fear a failure  
For they mean no harm, they are just to teach
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
Embrace it all, Soak in it,  
One thought at a time  
One problem at a time  
One victory at a time
</div>

<div style="margin: 1.5em 0; line-height: 1.8;">
The world is waiting  
For you, to lead the way  
To better future and better world  
Do not let others dim you down, for you are to be found
</div>

</div>
