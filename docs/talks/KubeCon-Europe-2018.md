At Nearmap, we have been working on an open source CI/CD solution for Kubernetes based workload called [KCD for Kubernetes Continous Delivery][kcd] (Formally known as [CVManager (Container Version Manager)][cvmanager]). We had oppertunity to present this solution at [KubeCon EU Copenhagen, Denmark 2018][kubecon_eu_2018]. For more details of this talk see [link][kubecon_eu_kcd] and associated blog with detailed info can be found [here][nearmap_blog_kcd].
