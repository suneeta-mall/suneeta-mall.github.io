# Replicability - an extension to reproducibility

This is [Part 3] - **End-to-end reproducible Machine Learning pipelines on Kubernetes** of technical blog series titled [Reproducibility in Machine Learning]. [Part 1] & [Part 2] can be found [here][Part 1] & [here][Part 2] respectively.


## Part 1: Reproducibility in Machine Learning - Research and Industry




## Replicability and 

The research community is quite divided when it comes to defining reproducibility and often mixes it up with replicability
