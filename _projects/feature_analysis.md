Learning more about manifold learning algorithms has been on my TODO list for a while. I also wanted to play with [Captum] for a while as well. The [feature_analysis] project started with the desire to dive into the details of t-SNE and UMAP and the willingness to dive further into the neural network feature, specifically convolutions, and then onto feature-based searches. 

In the current state, this project completes the deep dive into UMAP and t-SNE and applies that to multiple datasets. My detailed notes on this topic are documented in this [bog] titled `Review and comparison of two manifold learning algorithms: t-SNE and UMAP`. 


Early-stage exploration of [Captum] and weights and feature analysis can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/suneeta-mall/feature_analysis/blob/master/docs/MNIST.ipynb). However, in many ways, this is a work in progress. 

This project will be a ongoing slow burn person project for me to exlore into [activation atlas] and [Captum] and build on feature based indexers.
