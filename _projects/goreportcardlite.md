GoReportCard Lite, a slim version of original [Go Report Card][goreportcard] by [Shawn Smith](https://twitter.com/shawnps) and [Herman Schaaf](https://twitter.com/ironzeb) catered to be integrated into CI pipelines and can generate reports using local/private repositories. 

It is a web application that generates a report on the quality of go project. It uses several measures, including `gofmt`, `go vet`, `go lint` and `gocyclo`. For more info see [project][goreportcardlite]
