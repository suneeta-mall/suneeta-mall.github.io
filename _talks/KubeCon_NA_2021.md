Sometime early this year, I deployed a brand new thoroughly tested, and profiled application onto a self-managed Kubernetes cluster. Suffice to say, all hell broke loose. The pods were getting OOMKilled with error code 137 left and right. This sparked a massive crime scene investigation and some interesting insights were discovered. I [blogged][blog] about this in May, 2021. I have made some more progress on this since then, as a sidekick. 

I thought it would be a fun topic to share in KubeCon, right? Turn out, the committee thought so too (thank you!). 
So, I am very glad to be talking about this particular experience at [KubeCon North America 2021]. This [tallk] is titled `Who Killed My Pod? #Whodunit` and is scheduled for 13th Oct 2021. I will be going over my experience and talk about exactly who killed my pod #whodunit, why, and the fix!


Slides can be found [here][slides] and the video will be released after the event!
