href=2025/05/10/curious-cassie-20-revolutionizing-childrens-education-through-ai-powered-storytelling/#the-genesis-of-a-vision>The Genesis of a Vision</a></h3> <p>In 2022, I embarked on a mission that had long captivated my imagination: creating compelling narratives designed to inspire critical thinking in young minds ages 5-10. This endeavor was born from a profound concern—our digital age increasingly subjects children to passive entertainment, systematically diminishing their innate curiosity and imaginative capabilities. My solution? Develop engaging stories that weave the journeys of eminent scientists and philosophers into accessible narratives, transforming learning into an active, participatory experience.</p> <p>This vision materialized as the "Curious Cassie" book series, with each installment honoring a celebrated scientist by integrating their discoveries into narratives that make learning both enjoyable and engaging. I began with <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Curious-Cassies-beach-ride-quest/dp/0646869868">"Curious Cassie's Beach Ride Quest: A Celebration of Isaac Newton's Discoveries"</a>, choosing self-publication after encountering the traditional publishing industry's protracted timelines. This path revealed the formidable challenges novice authors face, particularly those writing for younger audiences, and highlighted areas where I needed to evolve as a children's author.</p> <p>Simultaneously, I authored <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-at/9781098145279/">"Deep Learning at Scale"</a> for O'Reilly, a technical work aimed at machine learning practitioners. This parallel experience provided invaluable insights into the transformative power of professional editorial processes. The iterative feedback cycles—critical analysis, editorial review, and meticulous proofreading—substantially elevated the manuscript's quality, underscoring the improvements needed in my self-published children's literature.</p> <p>Without a conventional editorial team, I relied on feedback from educational institutions and libraries to refine the "Curious Cassie" series. I recognized that various narrative elements required enhancement: storyline development, curiosity triggers, strategic suspense, and moments that evoke wonder and prompt young readers to question their surroundings. However, professional demands intervened, and this passion project entered an extended hiatus.</p> <h3 id=reigniting-the-vision-with-ai><a class=toclink href=2025/05/10/curious-cassie-20-revolutionizing-childrens-education-through-ai-powered-storytelling/#reigniting-the-vision-with-ai>Reigniting the Vision with AI</a></h3> <p>Today, I return with renewed determination to revitalize "Curious Cassie." My current approach leverages artificial intelligence to create an efficient publishing framework, allowing me to focus on my core passion: storytelling. By harnessing technological advancements, I aim to amplify my creative capabilities and bring Curious Cassie's adventures to life in ways that captivate and inspire young minds.</p> <h3 id=the-transformative-potential-of-generative-ai-in-childrens-literature><a class=toclink href=2025/05/10/curious-cassie-20-revolutionizing-childrens-education-through-ai-powered-storytelling/#the-transformative-potential-of-generative-ai-in-childrens-literature>The Transformative Potential of Generative AI in Children's Literature</a></h3> <p>Generative artificial intelligence is fundamentally reshaping children's literature, equipping authors with sophisticated tools that enhance storytelling craft. By leveraging breakthroughs in natural language processing and machine learning, writers can now develop dynamic narratives and character dialogues calibrated to specific age groups' comprehension levels and interests. These technologies serve as powerful creative allies, helping authors overcome creative blocks by generating contextually relevant content (Brown et al., 2020).</p> <p>AI-driven platforms are also revolutionizing narrative personalization. By analyzing reader interests and feedback, these systems facilitate the creation of stories that resonate deeply with children, fostering genuine engagement (Zhang et al., 2021). This personalized approach not only captivates young readers but empowers them through stories that reflect their experiences and interests.</p> <p>Furthermore, generative AI significantly enhances narrative refinement through simulated editorial processes that improve structure, pacing, and emotional resonance, mirroring traditional publishing's collaborative editing (Kucuk &amp; Kucuk, 2022). This iterative feedback loop ensures polished, impactful final products that enrich the reading experience.</p> <p>However, integrating AI into storytelling presents distinct challenges. Ethical considerations regarding originality, authorship, and narrative homogenization could potentially limit literary diversity (Gunkel, 2018). Authors must carefully balance AI's advantages while preserving their distinctive creative voice.</p> <h3 id=immersive-multi-sensory-storytelling><a class=toclink href=2025/05/10/curious-cassie-20-revolutionizing-childrens-education-through-ai-powered-storytelling/#immersive-multi-sensory-storytelling>Immersive Multi-Sensory Storytelling</a></h3> <p>The integration of visual, auditory, and virtual elements transforms storytelling, creating immersive experiences that engage multiple sensory pathways. Visual components—illustrations and animations—enhance comprehension and emotional connection, particularly among young readers. Research demonstrates that children exposed to illustrated narratives show improved understanding and recall compared to text-only formats (Duke &amp; Pearson, 2002; Hargreaves &amp; North, 1999; Baker, 2013).</p> <p>Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent the vanguard of innovative storytelling techniques. AR applications overlay digital content onto physical environments, enabling readers to explore narratives within their surroundings (Billinghurst &amp; Duenser, 2012). VR immerses users in fully realized digital worlds, fostering empathy and emotional engagement by allowing readers to experience stories from varied perspectives (Bailenson et al., 2008).</p> <p>By engaging multiple sensory channels, these approaches facilitate deeper cognitive processing and stronger narrative connections, fundamentally transforming how stories are created and consumed (Gee, 2003). The evolving potential for hybrid storytelling formats promises to further enrich educational opportunities through narrative (Slater &amp; Wilbur, 1997).</p> <p>This integration of diverse technologies enables the development of dynamic platforms where the 5 W's (What, When, How, Who, Where) and the 5 C's (Critical thinking, Creativity, Collaboration, Communication, and Citizenship) can be seamlessly woven into educational experiences through storytelling.</p> <h3 id=current-limitations-and-future-directions><a class=toclink href=2025/05/10/curious-cassie-20-revolutionizing-childrens-education-through-ai-powered-storytelling/#current-limitations-and-future-directions>Current Limitations and Future Directions</a></h3> <p>While emerging AI storytelling tools show promise, they remain in nascent stages of development. Platforms like TinyTeller AI, StoryPrompt, Sudowrite, StoryCraft AI, and AIStory offer valuable capabilities but also present limitations. Overreliance on AI-generated content may restrict exposure to diverse storytelling styles (Kim et al., 2024; Han &amp; Cai, 2023), while collaborative AI tools may inadvertently foster dependence rather than independence in creative expression (Fan et al., 2024; Hwang, 2024).</p> <p>The current digital education landscape often resembles a one-sided monologue, hampering interactive learning and stifling critical thinking. By reimagining education through the lens of interactive storytelling, we can create enriching platforms that empower learners to actively participate in knowledge acquisition.</p> <h3 id=the-path-forward><a class=toclink href=2025/05/10/curious-cassie-20-revolutionizing-childrens-education-through-ai-powered-storytelling/#the-path-forward>The Path Forward</a></h3> <p>I am committed to revitalizing Curious Cassie with AI-enhanced, multi-dimensional storytelling experiences that not only engage young readers but encourage critical thinking about the narratives they encounter. Alongside this revival, I am developing open-source tools to streamline the storybook publishing process, assisting first-time authors in complementing their skills through AI.</p> <p>In an era saturated with misinformation and superficial content, empowering young minds with critical thinking skills has never been more crucial. Through the synergy of human creativity and artificial intelligence, we can transform children's literature into a powerful vehicle for intellectual growth, fostering the next generation of thoughtful, engaged thinkers.</p> <h3 id=references><a class=toclink href=2025/05/10/curious-cassie-20-revolutionizing-childrens-education-through-ai-powered-storytelling/#references>References</a></h3> <ol> <li> <p>Baker, R.

It’s pretty impressive what <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> can do - unprecedented coherence, relevance and tone of delivery for a synthetic text generation. Well done OpenAI! </p> <p>I have to admit I have strongly resisted the urge to use it for purposes beyond joy, and exploration. It's been very hard to abstain, especially because I am extremely passionate about AI and also I work in AI. I truly, madly, deeply, utterly fear that we, as a community of carers of young people, are simply NOT ready for it! It’s the infancy state of due diligence to understand the societal implications and governance around it that scares me the most. I fear that while we, the grown-ups, are probably ready and raring to go at it, it’s our younger generations who are not at all ready for it. Once this genie is out of the bottle, out is just the way! And it’s the repeat of our social media fiasco all over again. Perhaps I am coming from a dark place of seeing how exponentially easily our kids are getting social media bullied and exploited with authorities still scrambling even after the fact on how to contain it! </p> <p>On a lighter note, selfishly speaking, I also fear depleting my creative and critical thinking abilities in favour of convenience and productivity. If Darwin’s theory is anything to go by, that’s one human talent we should preserve and reinforce, I think. Did I hear you say “But you can still be critical of the presented text?”? Sure, but we are also a Large Language Model in many ways :) - we get biased and we are lazy. Is not laziness the inspiration for many useful inventions of our times?</p> <p>As a mother of young kids and as someone who believes in lifelong learning, I made a <a href="https://curiouscassie.github.io">tiny effort</a> last year to write chapter books for early readers covering the discoveries of the great scientists of our past and present. In my debut release, I featured Sir Isaac Newton’s discoveries in a book titled “Curious Cassie's beach ride quest: A Celebration of Isaac Newton's Discoveries”. I tested the book on a sample of 5 kids all ranging from 6-7 years and observed extreme enthusiasm and an increased number of questions thereafter. Mission accomplished, eh? </p> <p>I failed this morning! I failed to resist the chatGPT urge to see what it would write instead. So here’s Me vs chatGPT, a debut author vs a stochastic parrot:</p> <ul> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors>ChatGPT vs Me: As a Children's Authors</a></li> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#chatgpt-vs-me-show-me-the-script>ChatGPT vs Me: Show me the script</a><ul> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#chatgpt>ChatGPT</a></li> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#prompt>Prompt</a><ul> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#chatgpts-response>ChatGPT's Response</a></li> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#verdict>Verdict</a></li> </ul> </li> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#prompt-1>Prompt</a><ul> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#chatgpts-response-1>ChatGPT's Response</a></li> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#verdict-1>Verdict</a></li> </ul> </li> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#prompt-2>Prompt</a><ul> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#chatgpts-response-2>ChatGPT's Response</a></li> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#verdict-2>Verdict</a></li> </ul> </li> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#prompt-3>Prompt</a><ul> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#chatgpts-response-3>ChatGPT's Response</a></li> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#verdict-3>Verdict</a></li> </ul> </li> <li><a href=2024/01/07/chatgpt-vs-me-as-a-childrens-authors/#me-me>Me!

It was a beautiful day in the magical forest. The sun was shining and the birds were singing. The trees were tall and green, and the flowers were blooming.

In the center of the forest was a small cottage, where a young girl named Lily lived with her parents. Lily was six years old, and she loved to explore the forest.

One day, while out on a walk, Lily stumbled upon a strange and magical place. It was a clearing filled with glittering diamonds and sparkling jewels.

&quot;Wow!&quot; exclaimed Lily. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before!&quot;
As she reached out to touch one of the diamonds, a bright light shone and a magical fairy appeared before her.

&quot;Hello, Lily,&quot; said the fairy. &quot;I am the guardian of the forest, and I have been waiting for you. You have a very special task to complete.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; asked Lily. &quot;What can I do?&quot;

&quot;There is a wicked witch who has been causing trouble in the forest,&quot; explained the fairy. &quot;She has been turning all of the animals into stone, and we need your help to stop her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot; said Lily, determined to help the animals.

Chapter 2: The Wicked Witch

Lily set out on her journey to find the wicked witch. She followed the fairy&#39;s instructions and travelled deep into the forest.
As she walked, she saw that the trees were no longer green and the flowers had withered away. It was clear that the witch had been causing destruction wherever she went.

Finally, Lily came to a dark and gloomy castle. She knew this was where the witch lived.

She tiptoed through the castle, trying not to make a sound. She could hear the witch cackling in the next room.

Lily peeked through the door and saw the witch stirring a bubbling pot. She had a long, crooked nose and sharp, pointed teeth.

&quot;Ah-ha!&quot; shouted the witch, turning to face Lily. &quot;I&#39;ve been expecting you, little girl. You won&#39;t be able to stop me from turning all of the animals into stone!&quot;

But Lily was not afraid. She remembered the fairy&#39;s words and knew she had to be brave.

&quot;I won&#39;t let you harm any more animals!&quot; said Lily, standing up to the witch.

The witch cackled and raised her wand, but Lily was quick. She grabbed a nearby broom and swung it at the witch, knocking the witches wand out of her hand.

The witch let out a cry of rage and fled the castle, leaving Lily to save the animals.

Chapter 3: The Great Celebration

With the witch gone, Lily was able to use her magic to turn the animals back to normal. The forest was filled with joy and celebration.

The fairy thanked Lily for her bravery and offered to grant her one wish.

&quot;I wish for the forest to always be a happy and safe place,&quot; said Lily.

The fairy nodded and waved her wand, granting Lily&#39;s wish. From then on, the magical forest was filled with happiness and peace.
Lily returned home to her parents, who were overjoyed to see her safe and sound. They threw a great celebration in her honour, and the whole forest came to join in the fun.

Lily knew that she would always treasure her adventure in the magical forest, and she hoped to have many more adventures in the future.

It was a beautiful day in the town of Maplewood, and Lily was excited for the annual science fair at her school. She had been working on her project for weeks, and she couldn&#39;t wait to show it off.

Lily&#39;s project was a model of the solar system, complete with miniature planets made out of clay and a sun made out of papier-mâché. She had worked hard to make sure everything was accurate and to explain the orbits of the planets in a way that other kids could understand.

As the science fair began, Lily set up her project at her table and waited for the judges to come by. She was a little nervous, but she knew she had done her best.

The judges were impressed by Lily&#39;s project and asked her lots of questions about the solar system. Lily was happy to answer and explain what she had learned.

In the end, Lily&#39;s project won first place in the science fair! She was so proud of herself and couldn&#39;t wait to show her parents.

Chapter 2: The Technology Club

After the science fair, Lily&#39;s teacher, Mrs. Kim, asked her if she would like to join the Technology Club at school. Lily was excited at the chance to learn more about science and technology, and she eagerly accepted.

In the Technology Club, Lily and her friends learned about all sorts of different topics, from coding and robotics to engineering and renewable energy. They built and programmed robots, designed and tested bridges, and learned about how solar panels work.

Lily loved the Technology Club and couldn&#39;t wait to go each week. She learned so much and had a lot of fun doing it.

Chapter 3: The Engineering Competition

One day, Mrs. Kim announced that the Technology Club was going to participate in an engineering competition. The students would have to design and build a Rube Goldberg machine, a complicated contraption that could perform a simple task in a creative and convoluted way.

Lily and her friends were up for the challenge and set to work planning and building their machine. They worked together as a team, using their knowledge of physics, engineering, and problem-solving to make their machine work.

Finally, the day of the competition arrived. Lily and her friends were nervous but excited to see how their machine would perform.

As they presented their machine to the judges, it worked perfectly, performing the simple task with a series of intricate steps. Lily and her friends were thrilled when they were announced as the winners of the competition!

Chapter 4: The Future Scientists

After the engineering competition, Lily and her friends in the Technology Club knew that they wanted to continue exploring science and technology in the future. They were already thinking about new projects and competitions they could participate in.

Lily knew that she wanted to be a scientist when she grew up, and she was grateful for all of the opportunities she had had to learn and explore in the Technology Club.

She knew that no matter what she did in the future, she would always have a passion for science and technology and the desire to learn more.

Cassie was a curious little girl who loved to learn about the world around her. One day, she was walking through her backyard when she saw an apple fall from a tree.

&quot;Hmm, I wonder why that happened?&quot; Cassie thought to herself. She climbed up the tree to see if she could find out more.

As she reached the top, she saw a man standing under the tree. It was Sir Isaac Newton! Cassie had heard of him before. He was a very smart man who had made many important discoveries.
&quot;Hello, Cassie,&quot; Sir Isaac said. &quot;I see you&#39;re curious about the apple.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Cassie replied. &quot;Why did it fall to the ground?&quot;
&quot;Ah, that&#39;s a good question,&quot; Sir Isaac said. &quot;I figured out that there is a force called gravity that pulls objects towards the ground. That&#39;s why the apple fell.&quot;

Cassie was amazed. &quot;Wow, that&#39;s so cool!&quot; she exclaimed.
Sir Isaac smiled. &quot;I also made many other discoveries,&quot; he told Cassie. &quot;Like the laws of motion, which explain how objects move and change speed. And I invented calculus, which helps us understand how things change over time.&quot;

Cassie&#39;s head was spinning with all this new information. She couldn&#39;t wait to learn more about Sir Isaac&#39;s discoveries.

&quot;Thank you for telling me all about this, Sir Isaac,&quot; Cassie said. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to learn more!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome, Cassie,&quot; Sir Isaac replied. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re interested in learning. Remember, the more you learn, the more you&#39;ll discover about the world around you.&quot;

Cassie smiled and climbed back down the tree, excited to keep learning and discovering new things.

[Illustration: Cassie is standing in her backyard, looking up at an apple falling from a tree.]

Cassie was a curious little girl who loved to learn about the world around her. One day, she was walking through her backyard when she saw an apple fall from a tree.

&quot;Hmm, I wonder why that happened?&quot; Cassie thought to herself. She climbed up the tree to see if she could find out more.

[Illustration: Cassie is climbing up the tree, with a determined look on her face.]

As she reached the top, she saw a man standing under the tree. It was Sir Isaac Newton! Cassie had heard of him before. He was a very smart man who had made many important discoveries.

&quot;Hello, Cassie,&quot; Sir Isaac said. &quot;I see you&#39;re curious about the apple.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Cassie replied. &quot;Why did it fall to the ground?&quot;

&quot;Ah, that&#39;s a good question,&quot; Sir Isaac said. &quot;I figured out that there is a force called gravity that pulls objects towards the ground. That&#39;s why the apple fell.&quot;

[Illustration: Sir Isaac is pointing to a diagram of the earth and the apple, with an arrow labeled &quot;gravity&quot; pointing from the earth to the apple.]

Cassie was amazed. &quot;Wow, that&#39;s so cool!&quot; she exclaimed.

Chapter 2: The Laws of Motion

After learning about gravity, Cassie couldn&#39;t wait to find out more about Sir Isaac&#39;s discoveries. She asked him to tell her more.

&quot;I also made many other discoveries,&quot; Sir Isaac said. &quot;Like the laws of motion, which explain how objects move and change speed.&quot;

[Illustration: Sir Isaac is holding a book labeled &quot;Laws of Motion,&quot; with diagrams of moving objects in the background.]

Cassie was fascinated. Sir Isaac explained that there are three laws of motion:

    Objects at rest stay at rest, and objects in motion stay in motion with the same speed and direction, unless acted upon by a force.
    The force needed to change the motion of an object is equal to the mass of the object times its acceleration.
    For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

[Illustration: Sir Isaac is pointing to a chalkboard with the three laws of motion written on it, with illustrations of objects in motion on either side.]

&quot;These laws help us understand how objects move and behave in the world around us,&quot; Sir Isaac said.

Chapter 3: Calculus

Cassie couldn&#39;t believe how much she was learning from Sir Isaac. She asked him if there was anything else he had discovered.

&quot;Yes, I also invented calculus,&quot; Sir Isaac said. &quot;It helps us understand how things change over time.&quot;

[Illustration: Sir Isaac is holding a book labeled &quot;Calculus,&quot; with a diagram of a curve on the cover.]

Cassie was a little confused. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked.

Sir Isaac explained that calculus is a way of studying how things change. &quot;For example, we can use calculus to understand how fast a ball is rolling down a hill, or how fast a plant is growing,&quot; he said.
[Illustration: Sir Isaac is pointing to a graph with a curve on it, with a ball rolling down a hill in the background.]
Cassie was amazed. &quot;That&#39;s so cool!&quot; she exclaimed.
Chapter 4: The End
After learning all about Sir Isaac&#39;s discoveries, Cassie was even more excited to keep learning and discovering new things. She thanked Sir Isaac for all of his help and said goodbye.
&quot;Remember, Cassie,&quot; Sir Isaac said as she walked away. &quot;The more you learn, the more you&#39;ll discover about the world around you.&quot;
[Illustration: Cassie is waving goodbye to Sir Isaac, with a big smile on her face.]
Cassie smiled and waved, excited to keep exploring and learning. She knew that there were so many more mysteries to solve and discoveries to be made.

Having good configuration management in place improves the user experience and simplifies experiment management. Some of the indirect advantages of having a good config solution are clean, reliable, and simple application code. This is true for any software application however some applications demand higher investment on the config piece than others. One key differentiator perhaps here is how many config fields one has and how each of these relates to the other. This can get real messy real quick with deep learning experiments where the list of config and hyperparameters can rapidly grow out of hand as soon as one breaks out of adhoc experimentations.</p> <ul> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#pydra---pydantic-and-hydra-for-configuration-management-of-model-training-experiments>Pydra - Pydantic and Hydra for configuration management of model training experiments</a></li> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#context>Context</a></li> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#hydra>Hydra</a><ul> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#a-simple-non-structured-config-example>A simple non-structured config example</a></li> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#an-extension-using-structured-config>An extension using structured config</a></li> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#some-other-interesting-features-of-hydra>Some other interesting features of hydra</a></li> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#interpolation>Interpolation</a></li> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#hydra-directives>Hydra Directives</a></li> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#where-hydra-falls-short>Where Hydra falls short?</a></li> </ul> </li> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#pydantic>Pydantic</a><ul> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#an-few-interesting-notes>An few interesting notes</a></li> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#can-pydantic-bridge-the-gaps-in-hydra>Can Pydantic bridge the gaps in hydra</a></li> </ul> </li> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#how-well-does-this-integrate-with-other-ecosystem-tools>How well does this integrate with other ecosystem tools</a></li> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#version-config>Version config</a></li> <li><a href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li> </ul> <h3 id=context><a class=toclink href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#context>Context</a></h3> <p>By definition model training configurations are hierarchial. For example, an experiment configuration can be broken down into data and model specifications. While these are loosely coupled specifications, they may enforce some degree of restrictions on each other e.g. model's output specification needs to be in line with data specification. A classifier network needs to output a 10 length vector if the data source is MNIST and 20 if it's PASCAL VOC. </p> <p>Overall, configuration solution for training experiments has following requirements:</p> <ol> <li>Ability to easily templatize configurations of various components of your training experiments.</li> <li>Ability to organize the configuration of training in a hierarchical fashion acknowledging the dependency and hierarchy of participating components.</li> <li>Without duplication, reuse configurations across modules wherever needed by means such as interpolation, expressions.</li> <li>Ability to compose config using templates and applying customization through overrides, environments etc.</li> <li>Being able to store and reuse the final assembled/compiled config and reproduce the experiments reliably.</li> <li>Support structured config consisting of potentially complex, canonical python types with strong validation support beyond type hint. This perhaps is optional if one is not interested in dynamic domain-specific validations - something that can not be achieved in serialized formats like yaml/json.</li> <li>Ability to version config and enforce a schema on the config specification for reliability and robustness.</li> <li>Ability to integrate easily into complex distributed launcher frameworks for both local and remote launch.</li> <li>A configuration management that nicely integrates into your echo-system of tools and is not very dictative.</li> </ol> <p>With that in mind, I evaluated a bunch of tools combination of <a href="https://hydra.cc/">Hydra</a> and <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">Pydantic</a> stood out as a good choice. In this post, I will go over my learnings of both the tools and also talk about gaps I still see present. Lastly, put forth a tentative solution for this gap. The structure of this post is as follows:</p> <ol> <li><a href="https://hydra.cc/">Hydra</a> - its strengths and also, what I think are its weakness.</li> <li><a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">Pydantic</a> - how it can be used to fill in the void of Hydra</li> <li>The missing bits of config management from Pydra i.e. both <a href="https://hydra.cc/">Hydra</a> &amp; <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">Pydantic</a></li> <li>The solution to bridging the gap</li> <li>Conclusion</li> </ol> <p><em>Note:</em> The samples and code shared in this post are available <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management">here</a>.</p> <h3 id=hydra><a class=toclink href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#hydra>Hydra</a></h3> <p><a href="https://hydra.cc/">Hydra</a> is a dynamic hierarchical config management tool with the ability to override parts of the config and also to compose the config through various sources (eg command line args, environment variables). It offers a nice solution to templated configurations that can be repurposed dynamically based on your objectives. Beyond rewriting rules, compositions, and interpolations to re-config templates, it also provides a mechanism to represent the config in plain old python object style and can take care of serialization and deserialization itself. On some noteworthy features side - with hydra you can fire multi-process workload on multiple instances of configurations derived from the same template source. This can be a really handy feature for many use cases including side-by-side comparisons. </p> <p>It is also extensible in a way that one can write their plugins to launch local or remote workload. Some other nice noteworthy features are runner config and callbacks. All in all, powered by <a href="https://github.com/omry/omegaconf">OmegaConf</a> this is a great tool for config management. </p> <h4 id=a-simple-non-structured-config-example><a class=toclink href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#a-simple-non-structured-config-example>A simple non-structured config example</a></h4> <p>Let's look at a simple use of hydra for yaml based config without involving python object model for config.

</code></pre></div> Sample code can be found <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management/blob/master/hydra/my_app_non_structured.py">here</a></p> <p>A few things happening in this script: 1. How is config loaded: The above script tells hydra to look for hierarchical config under <code>conf</code> as a base location for config directory, and <code>config.yaml</code> as top-level config specification. This setting is defaulted by python decorator <code>@hydra.main(config_path="conf", config_name="config")</code>. A user can override these settings and point the config location to another place by using <code>--config-dir</code> for the base directory and <code>--config-name</code> for top-level config.yaml as follows: <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>python<span class=w> </span>my_app_non_structured.py<span class=w> </span>--config-dir<span class=w> </span>conf_custom_hydra
python<span class=w> </span>my_app_non_structured.py<span class=w> </span>--config-name<span class=w> </span>config_hydra
</code></pre></div> 2. What format can I access config: Once hydra has loaded the config, it will be loaded as dict/dictionary and surfaced as <code>DictConfig</code> from <a href="https://github.com/omry/omegaconf">OmegaConf</a>. The benefit <code>DictConfig</code> is you can access the fields as variable accessors e.g. <code>cfg.db.driver</code> as shown in code above instead of dict str key access pattern. 3. Where is composition coming from: What's defined in <code>conf</code> directory is template config. Some values may be missing - which can be represented in yaml as <code>???</code>. It's also possible to override some values from the template config at runtime. An example of this is: <code>python my_app_non_structured.py db.user=suneeta</code> Here, the final used configuration that the application will see is: <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>db:
  driver: mysql
  user: suneeta
  pwd: secret
ui:
  create_db: true
  view: true
schema:
  database: school
  tables:
  - name: students

</code></pre></div> 4. What is the final config used in my run: Hydra saves the specifics of the config used in the run in its output location. By default the output location is <code>outputs/YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS/.hydra/config.yaml</code> which can be used to rerun the same run for reproducibility. <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>python<span class=w> </span>my_app_non_structured.py<span class=w> </span>--config-dir<span class=o>=</span>outputs/2022-03-16/13-45-29/.hydra
</code></pre></div> Hydra also allows you to configure job and run settings, an example of such configuration is located <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management/tree/master/hydra/conf_custom_hydra/hydra">here</a>. Alternatively, one can also override these settings in the main <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management/blob/master/hydra/conf/config_hydra.yaml">config.yaml</a> file:</p> <p><div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code><span class=nt>defaults</span><span class=p>:</span>

</code></pre></div> 5. Multi-run and templates: Multi-run allows users to run the multi-process workload on the same template of config but dynamically changing some values of it. Effectively, the user will be running multiple processes of the same code under different configurations. Parameter sweeps are a really good use case for when this may come in handy. In the following run, <code>multirun</code> is doing the trick triggering 3 different processes each for schema of school, support, and warehouse. <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>python<span class=w> </span>my_app_non_structured.py<span class=w> </span>db.user<span class=o>=</span>suneeta<span class=w> </span><span class=nv>schema</span><span class=o>=</span>school,support,warehouse<span class=w>  </span>--config-dir<span class=w> </span>conf_custom_hydra<span class=w> </span>--multirun
</code></pre></div></p> <p>Each process gets an int id assigned which the application can recognize. The index starts from 0, as shown in fig below. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/pydra/multi-runs.jpg> <em>Example Of multi-runs.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This is especially useful in distributed training runs where things like <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dist_tuto.html">RANK</a> of process needs to be known. This can be easily configured using hydra as <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management/blob/master/hydra/conf/config_hydra.yaml#L12">following</a>: <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>hydra:

</code></pre></div> A few things noteworthy to call out here: 1. <code>MISSING</code> is the replacement of yaml equivalent of missing denoted as <code>???</code>. 2. Hydra can only work with plain old python objects and at best with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">dataclasses</a> or drop-in replacements of <code>dataclasses</code>. 3. Structured config can not work with python primitives and cant serde (serialize and deserialize) canonical or complex python objects. Not even things like python pathlib <code>Path</code>. </p> <p>Once, the config object model is done, one should define <code>ConfigStore</code> and register <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management/blob/master/hydra/my_app.py#L57-L62">config objects</a>: <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>cs = ConfigStore.instance()
cs.store(name=&quot;config&quot;, node=Config)
cs.store(group=&quot;db&quot;, name=&quot;mysql&quot;, node=MySQLConfig)
cs.store(group=&quot;db&quot;, name=&quot;postgresql&quot;, node=PostGreSQLConfig)
cs.store(name=&quot;ui&quot;, node=View)
cs.store(name=&quot;schema&quot;, node=Schema)
</code></pre></div></p> <p>Here, <code>group</code> key in config registry indicates mutually exclusive groups. More about these can be found <a href="https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/structured_config/config_groups/">here</a>.</p> <p>How does hydra injection change then to support config store? Not by a lot, as shown in this <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management/blob/master/hydra/my_app.py#L75-L80">example</a>, changing <code>DictConfig</code> to your high-level config object <code>Config</code> in this case does the trick. Then, <code>OmegaConf.to_object(cfg)</code> unpacks dict config in your python object model. <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>@hydra.main(config_path=&quot;conf&quot;, config_name=&quot;config&quot;)
def my_app(cfg: Config) -&gt; None:    
    log.info(&quot;Type of cfg is: %s&quot;, type(cfg))
    cfg_dict = OmegaConf.to_container(cfg, throw_on_missing=False, resolve=True)

    cfg_obj = OmegaConf.to_object(cfg)
</code></pre></div></p> <p>This is all the application needs to do to move to structured config and features discussed earlier can be explored using the following commands: <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>python my_app.py
python my_app.py db.user=suneeta    
python my_app.py db.user=suneeta --config-dir conf_custom_hydra
# python my_app.py db.user=suneeta --config-name config_hydra
# Multi-run
python my_app.py db.user=suneeta schema=school,support,warehouse  --config-dir conf_custom_hydra --multirun
</code></pre></div> Code located <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management/blob/master/hydra/my_app.py">here</a></p> <p>There is another approach <a href="https://hydra.cc/">Hydra</a> offers to <a href="https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/instantiate_objects/overview/">instantiate objects</a> through the config. This approach requires the user to know which config is object-able beforehand as unpacking them into objects requires explicit calls to <code>instantiate</code> API. An example of such use is as follows, notice fully qualified class name in <code>__target__</code> field in config:</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/pydra/instantiate.jpg> <em>Example Of instantiate objects.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This feature, in my view, should be used sparingly as it tightly couples the config to application-specific objects. This kind of mixed-breed config handling approach is very hard to maintain and understand.</p> <h4 id=some-other-interesting-features-of-hydra><a class=toclink href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#some-other-interesting-features-of-hydra>Some other interesting features of hydra</a></h4> <h5 id=interpolation><a class=toclink href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#interpolation>Interpolation</a></h5> <p>Interpolation offers a means to refer to an existing config instead of duplicating it. It also allows users to use derive values obtained through string interpolation in config. An example of interpolation is shown below:</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/pydra/Interpolation.jpg> <em>Example Of instantiate objects.</em></p> </blockquote> <h5 id=hydra-directives><a class=toclink href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#hydra-directives>Hydra Directives</a></h5> <p><a href="https://hydra.cc/">Hydra</a> allows overriding package configuration employing directives; documentation for these is <a href="https://hydra.cc/docs/1.0/advanced/overriding_packages/">here</a>. In short, they offer means to rewrite and relocate config dynamically. I think this is evil and facilitates yaml engineering. It can also be a debugging nightmare if your intended use of config is beyond standard interfaces. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/pydra/directives-rewrites.jpg> <em>Example Of directives to rewrite config specifications.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Talking about directives, <code>__global__</code> are quite handy in managing configuration overrides. One example is shown here on <a href="https://hydra.cc/docs/patterns/configuring_experiments/">hydra samples itself</a></p> <h4 id=where-hydra-falls-short><a class=toclink href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#where-hydra-falls-short>Where Hydra falls short?</a></h4> <p>Overall, <a href="https://github.com/omry/omegaconf">OmegaConf</a> and <a href="https://hydra.cc/">Hydra</a> are two powerful tools for config management, however, I personally find the following shortcoming in these tools:</p> <ol> <li> <p>No support to serde (serialize and deserialize) canonical or complex python objects can be really annoying and causes more overhead for applications. Only primitive supports are a good start. </p> <p>1.1. <a href="https://github.com/omry/omegaconf">OmegaConf</a> and <a href="https://hydra.cc/">Hydra</a> does not support <code>Union</code> type in the config either.</p> </li> <li> <p>Support for structured config type is limited to plain old Python objects or dataclasses (and drop-in replacement thereof).</p> </li> <li> <p>Validation framework is a must-have in any config management framework. Anything users provide must be validated in the application for various things like type-checking, application-specific validation, constraint limits, etc. This is currently offloaded largely to application. The choice application is left with is using structured config as simple objects and performing all validation explicitly including obvious things like type checking. This is limiting in my view.</p> </li> <li> <p>Interpolation is great to have feature. Extension to this is being able to run expression-based interpolations eg list of items to the total item in the list. However, this support is lacking in <a href="https://hydra.cc/">Hydra</a> with <a href="https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/issues/91">issues</a> being raised.</p> </li> </ol> <h3 id=pydantic><a class=toclink href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#pydantic>Pydantic</a></h3> <p><a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">Pydantic</a> offers a runtime type enforcement and validation and is itself a data validation and settings management tool. It works with pure canonical python data models and provides two approaches for this: 1. <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/dataclasses/">Drop in replacement of dataclass</a> 2. <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/">BaseModel abstraction</a></p> <p>Through its validation framework and type checking pydantic offers schema enforcement and can serialize and deserialize objects from various formats including but not limited to yaml/json, xml, ORM, etc. Its field type support especially <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/#constrained-types">constrained types</a> are very rich and vastly simplifies application config validations. Eg can the image size be less than 0? What's the best approach to validate this? limit at config level or sprinkle that in the application where config is used?</p> <p>Overall, pydantic is a well-documented library, an example of its dataclass use is as shown <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management/blob/master/pydantic/model_dc.py">below</a>: <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code><span class=kn>import</span><span class=w> </span><span class=nn>logging</span>

An example of this is captured <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management/blob/master/pydantic/dynamic.py">here</a>: The use-case being, a list of classes is already provided in config in another module say data. You want to "infer" the total number of classes from this in the model config. In this case, you can interpolate and copy over a list of classes from the data module to model but your requirement of actually only caring about total classes is unfulfilled as you cant do expression-based interpolation just yet. In this case, <code>total_classes</code> can be defined as either list of int and then the total is deduced upon validation, leaving your in config object always representing total int value and logic-based deduction happening upon validation. Example of this is as follows:</li> </ol> <p><div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code><span class=kn>from</span><span class=w> </span><span class=nn>typing</span><span class=w> </span><span class=kn>import</span> <span class=n>List</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=n>Union</span>

</code></pre></div> I have not seen any issue in the use of validator like this but unsure if this is the intended use of validator support. Also, unsure why the validator returns in the said interface. </p> <ol> <li>Hydra's benchmarking is pretty favorable (see image below). However, they dont benchmark against OmegaConf and some other related tools, see details <a href="https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/pull/3264">here</a>. </li> </ol> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/pydra/benchmark.jpg> <em>Hydra's benchmarks.</em></p> </blockquote> <h4 id=can-pydantic-bridge-the-gaps-in-hydra><a class=toclink href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#can-pydantic-bridge-the-gaps-in-hydra>Can Pydantic bridge the gaps in hydra</a></h4> <p>Pydantic offers a strong validation framework something that's been missing in hydra. While drop-in replacement of pydantic dataclass works with hydra one can still miss out on the syntactical sugars of Model Config and still be limited to primitives and non Union types and more interesting constrained types of pydantic. </p> <p>It's fair to say that direct integration of hydra with pydantic is absent. The follow-up question should be, can we make it work? Sure we can :). </p> <p>An example demonstrating how <a href="https://hydra.cc/">Hydra</a> and <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">Pydantic</a> can be used in conjunction is shown <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management/blob/master/pydantic_hydra/example.py">here</a>. The secret sauce of integration lies in the following:</p> <ol> <li>Giving up on the use of <code>ConfigStore</code> of hydra</li> <li>Reading the config as <code>DictConfig</code> and unpacking to Pydantic BaseModel object via dict</li> </ol> <p>In short, this is two-liner: <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>    <span class=n>OmegaConf</span><span class=o>.</span><span class=n>resolve</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>cfg</span><span class=p>)</span>

</code></pre></div> where <code>Config</code> is a concrete implementation of <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">Pydantic</a>'s BaseModel. The decision we make it here is configs are specified in yaml format and we leave Hydra to manage template, composition, and all the good things of non-structured config management. Upon resolution and merge of config, we deserialize with Pydantic and get all the goodies of Pydantic validation, check, etc.</p> <h3 id=how-well-does-this-integrate-with-other-ecosystem-tools><a class=toclink href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#how-well-does-this-integrate-with-other-ecosystem-tools>How well does this integrate with other ecosystem tools</a></h3> <p>Given hydra can provide a final configuration in dict format, the configuration side can easily integrate with echo-system tools that care about configs. Given most experiment management and tracking tools support managing config as dict, this is less of a challenge. A post from <a href="https://wandb.ai/adrishd/hydra-example/reports/Configuring-W-B-Projects-with-Hydra--VmlldzoxNTA2MzQw">Weights and biases</a> goes in detail about integration. </p> <p>It's interesting to note that other features of Hydra like multirun and sweeps given they employ multi-processing may interfere with other tools employing MP techniques too. </p> <h3 id=version-config><a class=toclink href=2023/11/12/hydra-pydantic-config-management/#version-config>Version config</a></h3> <p>Versioning is very important practice to follow if one works with large, actively evolving code base. For the same reasons as REST APIs should be versioned, docker images are versioned, library releases are versioned, and so on, application config specifications should be versioned as well. If not for incremental updates then at least for breaking changes. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> actually does this really well, where users can bring their resource specification of supported version and it can work with that version creating ../resources for you. There is lot more complexity in config management that Kubernetes immplements but whats transferable here in my view is:</p> <ol> <li>When creating a run, always use latest version of config.</li> <li>Have a support in place where you can migrate your old configs to latest version of config so you can reproduce [not repeat] your experiments with newer features should you need to.</li> </ol> <p><a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management/blob/master/pydantic_hydra/example.py#L83-L172">This prototype</a> is a toy example to explore how to handle versioning in the config and provide a migration path for when old version config is provided. The assumption made here is, your training code only ever works with the latest version of config so the application code is simple and is always progressive. Whenever a breaking change is introduced, a new float version of config is created while the preceding version of config implements a migration path to the following version.</p> <p>Code shown below, represents Model config which has 3 versions <code>v</code> i.e. 1.0, 2.0, 3.0. Each version makes a breaking change to the previous but each concrete implementation implements a method <code>def to_next(self) -&gt; Optional[BaseModel]</code> that cracks at migrating the config to a new specification. <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code><span class=k>class</span><span class=w> </span><span class=nc>VersionModel</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>BaseModel</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=n>abc</span><span class=o>.</span><span class=n>ABC</span><span class=p>):</span>

</code></pre></div> Config templates, as shown <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/hydra_pydantic_config_management/tree/master/pydantic_hydra/conf/model">here</a> are versioned as well. </p> <p>Let's run through various scenarios: 1. A user wants to run a training and uses the latest config, they run <code>python example.py model=resnet_v3</code> 2. A user wants to run a training and uses the latest config but overrides some values, they run <code>python example.py model=resnet_v3 +model.zoom=25</code> 3. A user wants to re-run a training from an old config, they run <code>python example.py</code>. They use the v2 version of config and migration fails because field <code>context</code> require value is greater than or equal to 512 in v3 but used config in v2 template is 256. The user received feedback on what needs to change in config to make it work. 4. the Same user in #3 wants to re-run a training from the old config, they run <code>python example.py model.context=512</code>. They can run and the application performs the migration and the application actually only Model3 version of object config. 5. I want to expose the schema of Model config, how can I do this: <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>        _Models = Annotated[Union[Model1, Model2, Model3], Field(discriminator=&quot;v&quot;)]
        _schema = schema_json_of(_Models, title=&quot;Model Schema&quot;, indent=2)
</code></pre></div> This produces the following schema for model config: <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code><span class=p>{</span>

That's why we use dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce data dimensions so that the data is easy to work with and reason about. Manifold learning algorithms (MLA) are dimensionality reduction techniques that are sensitive to non-linear structures in data. The non-linearity is what sets manifold learning apart from other popular linear dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Non-linearity allows MLAs to retain complex and interesting properties of data that would otherwise be lost in linear reduction/projection. Because of this property, MLA is a very handy algorithm to analyze data - to reduce data dimensions to 2D or 3D, and visualize and explore them to find patterns in datasets.</p> <p><a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf">t-SNE</a> (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426">UMAP</a> are the two examples of MLA, that I will cover in this post. I will compare and contrast them and provide a good intuition of how they work and how to choose one over the other.</p> <p>Note that, MLAs are tweaks and generalizations of existing linear dimensionality reduction frameworks themselves. Similar to linear dimensionality reduction techniques, MLAs are predominantly unsupervised even though supervised variants exist. The scope of this post is unsupervised techniques, however.</p> <p>So what does non-linearity buys us? The following shows the difference in reduction using PCA vs t-SNE, as shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq6iPZVUxZU">McInnes</a> excellent talk:</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/PCA_vs_t-SNE_on_MNIST.jpg> Comparison of t-SNE and UMAP on MNIST dataset. (Image from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq6iPZVUxZU">McInnes</a> talk)</p> </blockquote> <p>As we can see, PCA retains some structure. However, it is very well pronounced in t-SNE, and clusters are more clearly separated. </p> <h3 id=neighbour-graphs><a class=toclink href=2022/06/09/feature-analysis---t-sne-vs-umap/#neighbour-graphs>Neighbour graphs</a></h3> <p><a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf">t-SNE</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426">UMAP</a> are neighbor graph technique that models data points as nodes, with weighted edges representing the distance between the nodes. Through various optimizations and iterations, this graph and layout are tuned to best represent the data as the distance is derived from the "closeness" of the features of the data itself. This graph is then projected on reduced dimensional space a.k.a. embedded space. This is a very different technique than matrix factorization as employed by PCA, ICA for example.</p> <h3 id=t-distributed-stochastic-neighbor-embedding-t-sne><a class=toclink href=2022/06/09/feature-analysis---t-sne-vs-umap/#t-distributed-stochastic-neighbor-embedding-t-sne>t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)</a></h3> <p><a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf">t-SNE</a> uses Gaussian joint probability measures to estimate the pairwise distances between the data points in the original dimension. Similarly, the student's t-distribution is used to estimate the pairwise distances between the data points in the embedded space (i.e. lower dimension or target dimension). t-SNE then uses the gradient descent technique to minimize the divergence between the two distributions in original and embedded space using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence technique.</p> <p><code>Perplexity</code> in t-SNE is effectively the number of nearest neighbors considered in producing the conditional probability measure. A larger perplexity may obscure small structures in the dataset while small perplexity will result in very localized output ignoring global information. Perplexity must be less than the size of data (number of data points) then; otherwise, we are looking at getting a blobby mass. The recommended range for perplexity lies between 5-50, with a more general rule that the larger the data, the larger the perplexity.</p> <p>Because of the use of KL divergence, t-SNE preserves the local structure in the original space, however, global structure preservation is not guaranteed. Having said that, when initialization with PCA is applied, the global structure is somewhat preserved. </p> <p>Talking more about structures, the scale of distances between points in the embedded space is not uniform in t-SNE as t-SNE uses varying distance scales. That's why it is recommended to explore data under different configurations to tease out patterns in the dataset. Learning rate and number of iterations are two additional parameters that help with refining the descent to reveal structures in the dataset in the embedded space. As highlighted in this great <a href="https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/">distill</a> article on t-SNE, more than one plot may be needed to understand the structures of the dataset.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/tsne-topo.jpg> Different patterns are revealed under different t-SNE configurations, as shown by <a href="https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/">distill</a> article. (Image from <a href="https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/">distill</a>).</p> </blockquote> <p>t-SNE is known to be very slow with the order of complexity given by O(dN^2) where d is the number of output dimensions and N is the number of samples. Barnes-Hut variation of t-SNE improves the performance [O(dN log N)] however Barnes-Hut can only work with dense datasets and provide at most 3d embedding space. The efficiency gain in Barnes-Hut is coming from changes in gradient calculation which are done with <code>O(n log n)</code> complexity, that uses approximation techniques which leads to about 3% error in nearest neighbor calculation.</p> <p>Because of these performance implications, a common recommendation is to use PCA to reduce the dimension before applying t-SNE. This should be considered very carefully especially if the point of using t-SNE was to explore into non-linearity of the dataset. Pre-processing with linear techniques like PCA will destroy non-linear structures if present.</p> <h3 id=uniform-manifold-approximation-and-projection-umap><a class=toclink href=2022/06/09/feature-analysis---t-sne-vs-umap/#uniform-manifold-approximation-and-projection-umap>Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426">UMAP</a></a></h3> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426">UMAP</a> is based on pure combinatorial mathematics that is well covered in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426">paper</a> and is also well explained by author McInnes in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq6iPZVUxZU">talk</a> and <a href=umap_doco>library documentation</a> is pretty well written too. Similar to <a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf">t-SNE</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426">UMAP</a> is also a topological neighbor graph modeling technique. There are several differences b/w <a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf">t-SNE</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426">UMAP</a> with the main one being that UMAP retains not only local but global structure in the data.</p> <p>There is a great post that goes into detail about <a href="https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/index.html">how UMAP works</a>. High level, UMAP uses combinatorial topological modeling with the help of simplices to capture the data and applies Riemannian metrics to enforce the uniformity in the distribution. Fuzzy logic is also applied to the graph to adjust the probability distance if the radius grows. Once the graphs are built then optimization techniques are applied to make the embedded space graph very similar to the original space one. UMAP uses binary cross-entropy as a cost function and stochastic gradient descent to iterate on the graph for embedded space. Both t-SNE and UMAP use the same framework to achieve manifold projections however implementation details vary. <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-exactly-umap-works-13e3040e1668">Oskolkov</a>'s post covers in great detail the nuances of both the techniques and is an excellent read.</p> <p>UMAP is faster for several reasons, mainly, it uses random projection trees and nearest neighbor descent to find approximate neighbors quickly. As shown in the figure below, similar to t-SNE, UMAP also varies the distance density in the embedded space.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/umap-math.jpg> Manifold reprojection used by UMAP, as presented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq6iPZVUxZU">McInnes</a> in his talk. (Image from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq6iPZVUxZU">McInnes</a> talk)</p> </blockquote> <p>Here's an example of UMAP retaining both local and global structure in embedded space:</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/umap-topo.jpg> Example of UMAP reprojecting a point-cloud mammoth structure on 2-D space. (Image provided by the author, produced using tool <a href="https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/index.html">1</a>)</p> </blockquote> <p>Here's a side-by-side comparison of t-SNE and UMAP on reducing the dimensionality of a mammoth. As shown, UMAP retains the global structure but it's not that well retained by t-SNE. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/tsne-vs-umap.jpg> Side by side comparison of t-SNE and UMAP projections of the mammoth data used in the previous figure. (Image provided by the author, produced using tool <a href="https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/index.html">1</a>) </p> </blockquote> <p>The explanation for this difference lies in the loss function. As shown in the following figure, UMAP uses binary cross-entropy that penalizes both local (clumps) and global (gaps) structures. In t-SNE however, due to KL Divergence as the choice of the cost function, the focus remains on getting the clumps i.e. local structure right.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/ce-umap.jpg> Cots function used in UMAP as discussed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq6iPZVUxZU">McInnes</a> talk.

UMAP only has the second part that contributes to getting the gaps right i.e. getting the global structure right.</p> <h3 id=comparison-table-t-sne-vs-umap><a class=toclink href=2022/06/09/feature-analysis---t-sne-vs-umap/#comparison-table-t-sne-vs-umap>Comparison table: t-SNE vs UMAP</a></h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Characteristics</th> <th>t-SNE</th> <th>UMAP</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Computational complexity</td> <td>O(dN^2) <br>(Barnes-Hut with O(dN log N) )</td> <td>O(d*n^1.14) <br>(<a href="https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/issues/8">emprical-estimates</a> O(dN log N))</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Local structure preservation</td> <td>Y</td> <td>Y</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Global structure preservation</td> <td>N <br>(somewhat when <code>init=PCA</code>)</td> <td>Y</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Cost Function</td> <td>KL Divergence</td> <td>Cross Entropy</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Initialization</td> <td>Random <br> (PCA as alternate)</td> <td>Graph Laplacian</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Optimization algorithm</td> <td>Gradient Descent (GD)</td> <td>Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Distribution for modelling distance probabilities</td> <td>Student's t-distribution</td> <td>family of curves (1+a*y<sup>(2b))</sup>-1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Nearest neighbors hyperparameter</td> <td>2^Shannon entropy</td> <td>nearest neighbor k</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id=exploring-dataset-with-t-sne-umap><a class=toclink href=2022/06/09/feature-analysis---t-sne-vs-umap/#exploring-dataset-with-t-sne-umap>Exploring dataset with t-SNE &amp; UMAP</a></h2> <p>Now that we have covered theoretical differences, let's apply these techniques to a few datasets and do a few side-by-side comparisons between t-SNE and UMAP.</p> <p>Source code and other content used in this exercise are available in this git repository - <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/feature_analysis">feature_analysis</a>.

As shown, increasing the perplexity, makes the local clusters very packed together. In this case, PCA based initialization technique was chosen because I want to retain the global structure as much as possible. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/mnist_t-sne_dif_perplex.jpg> Reprojection of MNIST image features on the 2D embedded space using t-SNE under different perplexity settings. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>It's quite interesting to see that the digits that are packed close together are: 1. 7,9,4 2. 3,5,8 3. 6 &amp; 0 4. 1 &amp; 2 5. That 6 is more close to 5 than 1 6. Likewise 7 is closer to 1 than 0.</p> <p>At a high level this co-relation makes sense, the features of the digits that are quite similar are more closely packed than digitals that are very different. Its also, interesting to note that 8 and 9 have anomalies that map closely to 0 in rare cases in embedded space. So what's going on? Following image overlays randomly selected images on the clusters produced by t-SNE @ perplexity of 50.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/mnist_tsne_with_img.jpg> Reprojection of MNIST image features on the 2D embedded space using t-SNE @ perplexity=50 with randomly selected image overlay. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>As we pan around this image, we can see a distinct shift in the characteristics of the digits. For example, the 2 digits at the top are very cursive and have a round little circle at the joint of the two whereas as we travel to the lower part of the cluster of 2s, we can see how sharply written the bottom 2s are. The bottom 2s features are sharp angular joints. Likewise, the top part of the cluster of 1s is quite slanty whereas the bottom 1s are upright. </p> <p>It's quite interesting to see that the 8's occasionally clustered together with 0's are quite round in the middle and do not have the sharp joint in the middle. </p> <p>So, what does MNIST data look like with UMAP? UMAP's embedded space also reflects the same grouping as discussed above. In fact, UMAP and t-SNE clustering in terms of digits grouping are very much alike. It appears to me that UMAP and t-SNE are mirror reflections when it comes to how digits are grouped. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/umap_mnist.jpg> Reprojection of MNIST image features on the 2D embedded space using UMAP. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>It's also very interesting to note how similar-looking 1s are that are reprojected to the same coordinates in the embedded space.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/ones_umap.jpg> One example of samples that get reprojected to the same coordinates in the embedded space using UMAP. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>Not all the data points that collide in embedded space will look exactly similar, the similarity is more in the reduced dimensional space. One such example is shown below. Here 1 and 0 are reprojected to the same coordinates. As we can see the strokes on the left side of 0 are very similar to strokes of 1. The circle of zero is not quite complete either. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/one-vs-zero.jpg> One example of two different digits getting reprojected to the same coordinates in the embedded space using UMAP. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>Here's also an example of samples falling into the same neighborhood in the embedded space that look quite distinct despite sharing some commonality (the strokes around the mouth of 4 and incomplete 8s)! </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/umap_odd_case.jpg> Example of 4 and 8s reprojected to the nearby coordinates in the embedded space using UMAP. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>Its unpredictable what tangible features have been leveraged to calculate the similarities amongst data points in the embedded space. This is because the main focus of MLAs has been distance measures and the embedded space is derived based on best effort using unsupervised techniques with evident data loss (due to dimensionality reduction). </p> <p>This was MNIST, where digits are captured with empty backgrounds. These are very easy cases because all the signals in the feature vectors are true signals that correspond to the digit as its drawn. When we start talking about visualizing data where there are noises in the signals then that case poses certain challenges. For example, taking the case of <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">cifar</a> dataset, the images of things are captured with a varying background as they are all-natural images unlike MNIST with a black background. In the following section, let's have a look at what happens when we apply t-SNE and UMA to the CIFAR dataset.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/CIFAR10-vs-MNIST.jpg> High-level differences between <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">cifar</a> and MNIST dataset.

As shown below results are less than impressive to delineate amongst CIFAR classes or perform any sort of features analysis. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/cifar-10-tsne.jpg> Results of CIFAR image feature visualization using t-SNE under different perplexity settings. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>So, what's going on? Let's overlay the images and see if we can find some patterns and make sense of the one big lump we are seeing. The following figure overlays the image. It's really hard to find a consistent similarity between neighboring points. Often we see cars and vehicles nearby but not consistently. They are intermixed with flowers and other classes. It's simply too much noise in the feature vector to do any meaningful convergence. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/cifar-10-t-sne-with-images.jpg> Results of CIFAR image feature visualization using t-SNE. Shows images in an overlay on randomly selected points. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>In the above two figures, we looked at analyzing CIFAR with t-SNE. The following plot is produced by using UMAP. As we can see it's not convincing either. Much like t-SNE, UMAP is also providing one big lump and no meaningful insights. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/cifar-umap.jpg> Results of CIFAR image feature visualization using UMAP. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>Following show images of 2 cats that are projected to the same location in embedded space. There is some similarity between the two images like nose, and sharp ears obviously but also the two images have varying distinct features.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/cifar-umap-collison.jpg> Results of CIFAR image feature visualization using UMAP showing samples of cats that are reprojected into the same located in the embedded space. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>Likewise, if we look at the following figure where deer and frog are co-located in embedded space, we can see the image texture is very similar. This texture however is the result of normalization and grayscale conversion. As we can see, a lot goes on in nature scenes and without a clear understanding of which features to focus on, one's features can be other's noise. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/umap_frog_deer.jpg> Results of CIFAR image feature visualization using UMAP. Shows images in an overlay on randomly selected points. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>t-SNE and UMAP are feature visualization techniques and perform best when the data vector represents the feature sans noise. </p> <h3 id=what-to-do-when-there-is-noise-in-features><a class=toclink href=2022/06/09/feature-analysis---t-sne-vs-umap/#what-to-do-when-there-is-noise-in-features>What to do when there is noise in features?</a></h3> <p>So, what can we do if there are noises in our feature vectors? We can apply techniques that reduce noises from feature vectors before applying manifold learning algorithms. Given the emphasis on nonlinearity in both t-SNE and UMAP (to preserve nonlinear features), it is better to choose a noise reduction technique that is nonlinear. </p> <p><a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/autoencoders.html">Autoencoder</a> is a class of unsupervised deep learning techniques that learns the latent representation of the input dataset eliminating noises. Autoencoder can be non-linear depending on the choices of layers in the network. For example, using a convolution layer will allow for non-linearity. If noises are present in the feature vector then an autoencoder can be applied to learn latent features of a dataset and to transform samples to noise-free samples before applying manifold algorithms. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426">UMAP</a> has native integration with Tensorflow for similar use cases that is surfaced as <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parametric_umap.html">parametric UMAP</a>. Why parametric because autoencoders/neural networks are parametric! i.e. increasing data size will not increase parameters - the parameters may be large but will be fixed and limited. This approach of transforming input feature vectors to the latest representation not only helps with noise reduction but also with complex and very high dimensional feature vectors. </p> <p>The following figure shows the results of applying autoencoder before performing manifold algorithm t-SNE and UMAP for feature visualization. As we can see in the result, the clumps are much more compact and the gaps are wider. The proximity of MNIST classes remains unchanged, however - which is very nice to see.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/umap_tsne-parametric_umap.jpg> Results of applying autoencoder on MNIST before applying manifold algorithm t-SNE and UMAP. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>So how does it affects the features that contribute to proximities/neighborhood of data? The manifold algorithm is still the same however it's now applying on latent feature vector as produced by autoencoders and not raw features. So effectively, the proximity factor is now calculated on latent representation and not directly on perceptible features. Given the digit clusters are still holding global structure and it's just more packed together within the classes, we can get the sense that it's doing the right things if intra-class clumps can be explained. Let's look at some examples. The following shows a reprojection in the embedded space where 4,9 and 1 are clustered together into larger clusters of 1s. If we look closely the backbone of all these numbers is slanting at about 45 degrees and perhaps that has been the main driving factor. The protruding belly of 4 and 9 are largely ignored but also they are not very prominent. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/MNIST-Parametric-UMAP.jpg> Example of co-located 1s, 4 &amp; 9 in embedded space obtained by applying Paramertic UMAP on MNIST. (Image provided by author)</p> </blockquote> <p>More importantly, looking at the dataset (in the following figure), there are not as many 9s or 4s that have a backbone at that steep slant of 45 degrees. This is more easily shown in the full-scale overlay in the following figure (sparsely chosen images to show to make it more comprehensible). We can see all samples are upright 4s and 9s where there is a slant the protrusion is more prominent. Anyhow, we don't need to get overboard with this as manifold algorithms are not feature detection algorithms and certainly can't be compared to the likes of more powerful feature extraction techniques like convolution. The goal with manifold is to find global and local structures in the dataset. These algorithms work best if signals in datasets are noise-free where noise includes features/characteristics we want ignored in the analysis. A rich natural background is a very good case of noise as shown already in the CIFAR case.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/feature-analysis/overlay_on_t-SNE_parametric.jpg> Images overlaid on t-SNE of auto-encoded features derived from MNIST dataset.

Multi-class is certainly the easy case - each sample only needs to be color-coded for one class so is easy to visualize. We are also expecting class-specific data to be clumped together mostly (perhaps not always and depends on intent but may be more commonly).</p> <p>If multi-label data consists of exclusive classes similar to <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html">Satnford Cars Dataset</a> where options within the make and the models of cars are mutually exclusive, then splitting the visualization to the group of exclusive cases could be very helpful. </p> <p>However, if the multi-label dataset is more alike <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mlrsnet">MLRSNet</a> where classes are independent then it's best to first analyze the data class agnostic and explore if there are any patterns in features and proceed based on this.</p> <h2 id=can-we-apply-this-to-understand-what-neural-networks-are-doing><a class=toclink href=2022/06/09/feature-analysis---t-sne-vs-umap/#can-we-apply-this-to-understand-what-neural-networks-are-doing>Can we apply this to understand what neural networks are doing?</a></h2> <p>A lot of work has been done in the area of explainability and feature understanding that is very well documented in <a href="https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/">distill</a> blogs. The underlined idea is that we can take the activation of the layers of the neural network and explore what features it is that that particular layer is paying attention to. The activations are essentially the signal that is fired for a given input to the layer. These signals then formulate the feature vector for further analysis to understand where and what the layer is paying more attention to. T-SNE and UMAP are heavily used in these analyses. </p> <p>The <a href="https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/">distill</a> blogs are very well documented and highly recommended for reading if this is something that is of interest to you.</p> <h3 id=conclusion><a class=toclink href=2022/06/09/feature-analysis---t-sne-vs-umap/#conclusion>Conclusion</a></h3> <p>This post was focused on the fundamentals of manifold learning algorithms, and diving into the details of t-SNE and UMAP. This post also compared and contrasted t-SNE and UMAP and presented some analysis of MNIST and CIFAR datasets. We also covered what to do if we have a very high dimensional dataset and also if we have noises in the dataset. Lastly, we touched on what to do if your dataset is multi-label. </p> <p>In the follow-up, I will cover how we can utilize t-SNE and UMAP to better understand what neural networks are doing and apply it in conjunction with convolutions as feature extractors. </p> <p>[umap_doco] https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_umap_works.html</p> </div> </article> <article class="md-post md-post--excerpt"> <header class=md-post__header> <nav class="md-post__authors md-typeset"> <span class=md-author> <img src=/resources/me.png alt="Suneeta Mall"> </span> </nav> <div class="md-post__meta md-meta"> <ul class=md-meta__list> <li class=md-meta__item> <time datetime="2022-05-16 00:00:00">May 16, 2022</time></li> <li class=md-meta__item> in <a href=category/machine-learning/ class=md-meta__link>Machine Learning</a>, <a href=category/ai/ class=md-meta__link>AI</a>, <a href=category/deep-learning/ class=md-meta__link>Deep Learning</a>, <a href=category/data/ class=md-meta__link>Data</a>, <a href=category/data-centric-ai/ class=md-meta__link>Data-Centric-AI</a></li> <li class=md-meta__item> 16 min read </li> </ul> </div> </header> <div class="md-post__content md-typeset"> <h2 id=confident-learning-label-errors-are-imperative-so-what-can-you-do><a href=2022/05/16/confident-learning-and-clean-data/ class=toclink>Confident Learning: Label errors are imperative! So what can you do?</a></h2> <p>What makes deep-learning so great, despite what you may have heard, is data! There is an old saying, that sums it up pretty well:</p> <blockquote> <p>The model is only as good as the <span style=color:red>data</span>! <br></p> </blockquote> <p>Which brings us to the real question, exactly how good is your data? Collecting ground truth/training datasets is incredibly expensive, laborious, and time-consuming. The process of labeling involves searching for the object of interest and applying prior knowledge and heuristics to come to a final decision. A decision to represent if the object (of interest) is present and if so, annotate it to provide extra information like bounding box, and segmentation mask. </p> <p>There are several factors at play in this process that leads to error in the dataset. The question is what can we do about it? In this post, I will touch on some of the reasons why labeling error occurs, why the errors in labels are imperative, and what are the tools and techniques one can use to manage errors in the label datasets. Then, I will dive into the detail of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">confident learning</a>. I will also demonstrate the use of <a href="https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab">cleanlab</a>, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">confident learning</a> implementation [1], to easily find noise in the data.</p> <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Before diving into the details, I would like to acknowledge that, at the time of writing this post, I am not affiliated with or sponsored by <a href="https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab">cleanlab</a> in any capacity.</p> <p>This post is broken down into the following sections:</p> <ul> <li><a href=2022/05/16/confident-learning-and-clean-data/#confident-learning-label-errors-are-imperative-so-what-can-you-do>Confident Learning: Label errors are imperative!

One broad class for such errors is tooling/software bugs. These can be controlled and managed using good software best practices like tests covering both software and the data. The other class of errors is the one where the mistakes are coming from the labelers themselves. These are incredibly harder issues to track. Because labelers are the oracle in this process of deep learning after all! If we don't trust them, then who do we trust?</p> <p>There is a very interesting work by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225041737_Automated_detection_of_heuristics_and_biases_among_pathologists_in_a_computer-based_system">Rebecca Crowley</a> where she provides a detailed chart of a range of reasons why an object (of interest) may be missed while searching in a scene or also why a wrong final decision may be made by them [4]. Some directly impacting labeling in my view are:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Search Satisficing</strong>: The tendency to call off a search once something has been found, leading to premature stopping, thus increasing the chance of missing annotations[4]. This more applies to scenarios where more than one annotation is needed. For example, multi-label or segmentation annotation (dog and pen are in the image but the labeler only annotates for the dog and does not spend enough time to spot the pen and capture in labels).</li> <li><strong>Overconfidence &amp; Under-confidence</strong>: This type of labeling error relates to one's feeling-of-knowing [4] that is over or underestimated.</li> <li><strong>Availability</strong>: There is an implicit bias in annotating it wrongly if something is frequently occurring or rarely occurring [4]. It is particularly true for challenging labeling tasks. For instance, if the cancer prevalence rate in a location is 0.01%, then the labeler, when labeling a not-so-straightforward case, is more likely to mark a non-cancer than cancer.</li> <li><strong>Anchoring/Confirmation bias</strong>: When a labeler makes a pre-emptive decision [4] about a labeling task outcome and then looks for information to support that decision. For example, believing they are looking at a cancerous case, they start to search for abnormality in the image to support the finding that this case is cancer. In this unfair search/decision process, they are more likely to make mistakes.</li> <li><strong>Gambler's Fallacy</strong>: When they are encountered with a repeated pattern of similar cases, then they are likely to deviate and favor an outcome that breaks that pattern [4].</li> <li>Amongst all these, <strong>Cognitive Overload</strong> is also a valid and fair reason for errors in labels.</li> </ol> <h3 id=labeling-efficiency-tricks-that-increase-the-risk-of-labeling-errors><a class=toclink href=2022/05/16/confident-learning-and-clean-data/#labeling-efficiency-tricks-that-increase-the-risk-of-labeling-errors>Labeling efficiency tricks that increase the risk of labeling errors</a></h3> <p>Given the process to procure a labeling dataset is expensive, some clever tricks and techniques are occasionally applied to optimize the labeling funnel. While some focus on optimization through labeling experience such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06874">Fast Interactive Object Annotation</a><sup>[5]</sup>, other techniques focus on using auto-labeling techniques to reduce the labeling burden a bit to aid the labelers. Tesla has a very powerful mechanism to realize auto-labeling at scale as talked about in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a510m7s_SVI">2021 CVPR by Karpathy</a>. They sure have the advantage of having feedback (not just the event that's worth labeling but also what did the driver do or if that led to a mishap). It's an advantage that not all deep-learning practicing organizations have! Impressive nonetheless! Then we also have the weakly supervised class of training regimes that I won't go into detail about (perhaps a topic for another day)!</p> <p>The thing is, the cleverer tricks you employ to optimize this process, the higher the chances of error in your dataset. For instance, using the model in the loop for labeling is being increasingly used to optimize the labeling process (<a href="https://suneeta-mall.github.io/talks/She_Builds_on_AWS_2020.html">as detailed in this presentation</a>), as an auto-labeling/pre-label trick, wherein predicted labels are shown to the labelers and the labeler only fine-tunes the annotation instead of annotating from the get-go. This process has two main challenges:</p> <p>a) It may introduce a whole gamut of bias in labels <a href="2022/05/16/confident-learning-and-clean-data/# reasons-for-labeling-errors">as discussed above in (Reasons for labeling errors</a>.</p> <p>b) If the model is not on par with human labelers, the labor, and boredom of correcting a garbage prior label increase the risk of errors in the dataset. This is a classic case of cognitive overload.</p> <p>If this example was not enough, let's take a case of auto labeling <a href="https://suneeta-mall.github.io/talks/KGC_NY_2022.html">using ontology/knowledge graph</a>. Here, the risk of error propagation is too high if the knowledge encoded in the ontology/knowledge graph is biased. For example, if it's an ocean water body it cants be a swimming pool. Because well, contrary to common knowledge ocean pools do exist. Or if it's a house it's not a waterbody - because you know lake houses do exist!</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/cleanlab/47f76ecac3e3bcc2b5b21e30ea10d336.jpeg> <span style=text-align:center;>Ocean Pool/Rock Pool @Mona Vale NSW AU (Image is taken from the internet! @credit: unknown)</span></p> </blockquote> <h3 id=errors-in-labels-are-imperative><a class=toclink href=2022/05/16/confident-learning-and-clean-data/#errors-in-labels-are-imperative>Errors in labels are imperative</a></h3> <p>Given the challenges discussed so far, It is fair to say that errors are imperative. The oracle in this process are labelers and they are only just human!</p> <blockquote> <p>I am <span style=color:red>not perfect</span>; I am only <span style=color:red>human</span></p> </blockquote> <p>Evidently, there is <em>an estimated average of at least 3.3% errors across the 10 popular datasets, where for example label errors comprise at least 6% of the ImageNet validation set</em> <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14749">2</a></sup>.</p> <p>Assuming, human labelers will produce a perfectly clean dataset is, well, overreaching to say the least. If one cares, one can employ multiple labelers to reduce the error by removing the noise through consensus. This is a great technique to produce a high-quality dataset but it's also many times more expensive and slow thus impractical as standard modus-operandi. Besides being expensive, this does not guarantee a clean dataset either. This is evident from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14749">Northcutt's NeurIPS 2021</a><sup>[2]</sup> work on analyzing errors in the test set of popular datasets that reported order of hundred samples across popular datasets where an agreement could not be reached on true ground truth despite looking at collating outcomes from labelers (see table 2 in the paper for reference).</p> <p>For the last few years, I have been using model-in-loop to find samples where there are disagreements in the dataset with the models. Some of the other techniques that I have found useful are leveraging loss functions, as called out by Andrej Karpathy! More recently, I have seen a huge benefit of deploying <a href="https://suneeta-mall.github.io/talks/KGC_NY_2022.html">ontology-based violations</a> to find samples that are either a) labeling errors or b) extreme edge cases that we were not aware of (aka out of distribution [OOD] samples). </p> <blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p dir=ltr>When you sort your dataset descending by loss you are guaranteed to find something unexpected, strange and helpful.</p>&mdash; Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1311884485676294151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async= src="../assets/external/platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p><br></p> <p>However, I realized I have been living in oblivion when I came across project <a href="https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab">cleanlab</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/cgnorthcutt">Northcutt</a>'s group and started digging in a bunch of literature around this exact space! I was excited to uncover all the literature that proposed the tricks and tips I have been using to date without being aware of them. Well no more!! In the following sections, I will cover what I have learned reading through this literature.</p> <h3 id=exactly-what-is-confident-learning><a class=toclink href=2022/05/16/confident-learning-and-clean-data/#exactly-what-is-confident-learning>Exactly, what is Confident learning?</a></h3> <blockquote> <p>All models are wrong, but some are <span style=color:red>useful</span>!</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">Confident learning</a><sup>[1]</sup> (CL) is all about using all the useful information we have at hand to find noise in the dataset and improve the quality of the dataset. It's about using one oracle (the labelers) and testing it using another oracle in the build i.e. the model! At a very high level, this is exactly what we have been more generally calling model-in-the-loop!</p> <blockquote> <p>Learning exists in the context of data, yet notions of confidence typically focus on model predictions, not label quality!<sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">1</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">Confident learning</a> (CL) is a class of learning where the focus is to learn well despite some noise in the dataset. This is achieved by accurately and directly characterizing the uncertainty of label noise in the data. The foundation CL depends on is that <code>Label noise is class-conditional, depending only on the latent true class, not the data</code> <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">1</a></sup>. For instance, a <code>leopard</code> is likely to be mistakenly labeled as a <code>jaguar</code>. This is a very strong argument and in practice untrue. I can argue that the scene (ie the data) has implications for the labeler's decisions. For instance, a dingy sailing in water is less likely to be labeled as a car if it's in water. In other words, would not a dingy being transported in a lorry is more likely to be labeled as a car than when it was sailing on the water? so data and context do matters! <br> This assumption is a classic case of, <code>in statistics any assumption is fair if you can solve for x!</code>. Now that we have taken a dig at this, it's fair to say that this assumption is somewhat true even if not entirely. </p> <p>Another assumption CL makes is that rate of error in the dataset is &lt; &frac12;. This is a fair assumption and is coming from <a href="http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~lreyzin/papers/angluin88b.pdf">Angluin &amp; Laird</a>'s<sup>[3]</sup> proposed method for the class conditional noise process which is used in CL to calculate the joint distribution of noisy and true labels.</p> <p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">Confident learning</a>, a reasonably well performant model is used to estimate the errors in the dataset. First, the model's prediction is obtained then, using a class-specific threshold setting confident joint distribution matrix is obtained; which is then normalized to obtain an estimation of the error matrix. This estimated error matrix then builds the foundation for dataset pruning, counting, and ranking samples in the dataset.</p> <blockquote> <p>Estimating the joint distribution is challenging as it requires disambiguation of epistemic uncertainty (model-predicted probabilities) from aleatoric uncertainty (noisy labels) but useful because its marginals yield important statistics used in the literature, including latent noise transition rates latent prior of uncorrupted labels, and inverse noise rates. <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">1</a></sup>.</p> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/cleanlab/cl.jpg> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">Confident learning</a> in pictures<sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">1</a></sup>.</p> </blockquote> <p>The role of a class-specific threshold is useful to handle variations in model performance for each class. This technique is also helpful to handle collisions in predicted labels. </p> <p>What's great about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">Confident learning</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab">cleanlab</a> (its python implementation of it) is that while it does not propose any groundbreaking algorithm, it has done something that is rarely done. Bring together antecedent works into a very good technical framework that is so powerful that it rightfully questions major datasets that shape the evolution of deep learning. Their work on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14749">analysis</a> of 10 popular datasets including MNIST is well appreciated. This is also a reminder that we are massively overfitting the entire deep learning landscape to datasets like MNIST, and ImageNet, as they are pretty much, must use the dataset to benchmark and qualify bigger and better algorithms and that, they have at least 3.3% errors if not 20% (as estimated by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14749">Northcutt's group</a>)!</p> <p>This approach was used in side by side comparison where samples were pruned either randomly (shown in orange in below fig) or more strategically via CL to remove noisy samples only (shown in blue below fig). The accuracy results as shown below. CL is doing better than random prune!</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/cleanlab/cl_result.jpg> Borrowed from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">Confident learning</a><sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">1</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Following are an example of some of the samples that CL flags as noisy/erroneous, also including the edge cases where a) neither were true and b) Its either the CL suggestion or provided label but unclear which of the two are correct (non-agreement):</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/cleanlab/cl_results_image.jpg> Examples of samples corrected using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14749">Confident learning</a><sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14749">2</a></sup>.</p> </blockquote> <p>CL is not 100% accurate.

This is more likely to happen in multi-label settings and even more complex labeling setting like segmentation or detection than in multi-class classifications. For example, if there is a TV and water bottle in an image and the only annotation present is for the TV, and the water bottle is missed entirely! This is currently not modeled in CL as relies on building a pairwise class-conditional distribution between the given label and the true label. If the given label was a cat but the actual label was the dog for example. The framework itself does not allow it to model for the missing label when a true label is present. </p> <p>Pairwise class-conditional distribution as proposed in CL also limits its use in multi-label settings. Explicitly when multiple labels can co-exist on the same data. For example, both the roof and swimming pool can be present in the image and they are not necessarily exclusive. This limitation comes from pairwise (single class gives vs single class predicted) modeling. This is different from say <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html">Stanford Car Dataset</a> where make and model are predicted as multiple labels but they are exclusive ie a vehicle can be ute or hatchback but that is exclusive to it being made by Toyota or Volvo. Exclusivity in this case allows for modeling Pairwise class-conditional distribution. These are more multi-label multi-class modeled using multi-headed networks. True multi-label datasets can't be modeled like these pairwise joint distributions. They can perhaps be modeled using more complex joint distribution formulations but that would not scale very well. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">Confident learning</a><sup>[1]</sup> as it stands currently is a computationally expensive algorithm with an order of complexity being O(m2 + nm). </p> <p>Having said these, it is probably something that is not explained in the literature as it seems that <a href="https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab">cleanlab</a> itself supports multi-label classification. Conceptually I am unclear how multi-label works given the said theory. The support for multi-label is developing as issues are being addressed on this tool <a href="https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab/issues/263">1</a>,<a href="https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab/issues/55">2</a>.</p> <h3 id=hands-on-of-label-noise-analysis-using-cleanlab-for-multi-label-classification><a class=toclink href=2022/05/16/confident-learning-and-clean-data/#hands-on-of-label-noise-analysis-using-cleanlab-for-multi-label-classification>Hands on of label noise analysis using cleanlab for multi-label classification</a></h3> <p>Now that we have covered the background and theoretical foundations, let's try the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068">confident learning</a> out in detecting label noise using its implementation <a href="https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab">cleanlab</a>. Specifically, I will use multi-label classification given the uncertainty around it (as discussed above)!. For this hands-on, I will use <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mlrsnet">MLRSNet</a> dataset. This spike is built using ResNet as a multi-label image classifier predicting 6 classes that can co-exist at the same time. These classes are <code>['airplane', 'airport', 'buildings', 'cars', 'runway', 'trees']</code> and derived off <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mlrsnet">MLRSNet</a> subset - i.e. only using <code>airplane</code> and <code>airport</code>.</p> <p>The source code and <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/label_noise/blob/master/label_noise_notebook.ipynb">this notebook</a> for this project is <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/label-noise">label-noise</a> Github repository. <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/label_noise/blob/master/label_noise_notebook.ipynb">The notebook</a> checks how well <a href="https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab">cleanlab</a> performs in detecting label noise and identifies out-of-distribution samples, weird samples, and also errors!</p> <h4 id=model-info><a class=toclink href=2022/05/16/confident-learning-and-clean-data/#model-info>Model info</a></h4> <p>Train and validation loss from the model trained using <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/label-noise">label-noise</a> for 19 epochs.

While no small-efforts are required to minimize the errors in the dataset, management of the errors in the dataset is also warranted. The management to find noisy data, out of distribution data, or data that represents a systematic flaw (software/tooling issues or issues in the understanding of a concept that defines the target class). Approaches like model-in-loop, or additional information like ontology to find such noises or errors in the dataset are effective techniques. Confident learning provides a solid foundation for analyzing a dataset of noisy or OOD samples — a technique that's quite effective for multi-class approaches, with the evolving support for multi-label classification.

So many groundbreaking advances are happening in this area but I have often found myself wondering why the only thing that makes it all shine - yes I am talking about the dark horse of deep learning <em>the</em> <em>data</em> is so underappreciated. The last few years of DL research have given me much joy and excitement and I carry hope now that going forward we can see some exciting progress in this space that explore advances in deep learning in conjunction with data!

An early study of image models (classification and segmentation, year 2017) noted that the performance of the model increases logarithmically as the training dataset increases <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02968">1</a>. The belief that increasing training dataset size will continue to increase model performance has been long-held. This has also been supported by another empirical study that validated this belief across machine translation, language modeling, image classification, and speech recognition <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00409">2</a> (see figure 1). </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/dataset_size_scale.jpeg> *Figure 1: Shows relationship between generalization error and dataset size (log scale) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00409">2</a> *</p> </blockquote> <p>So, the bigger dataset is better right? Almost! A theoretical foundation has been laid out in the form of power-law i.e $ \begin{equation} \label{power_law} ε(m) \approx αm^{β_g} \end{equation} $ wherein <em>ε</em> is generalization error, <em>m</em> is the number of samples in the training set, <em>α</em> is a constant property of the problem/DL task, and <em>β<sub>g</sub></em> is the scaling exponent that defines the steepness of the learning curve. Here, <em>β<sub>g</sub></em>, the steepness of the curve depicts how well a model can learn from adding more data to the training set <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00409">2</a> .(see figure 2) Empirically, <em>β<sub>g</sub></em> was found to be between −0.07 and −0.35 despite theory suggesting <em>β<sub>g</sub></em> to be 0.5 or 1. Nonetheless, the logarithmic relationship holds. As shown in figure 2, the gain eventually tapers in irreducible error. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/power-law.jpeg> *Figure 2: Power Law curve showing model trained with a small dataset only as good as random guesses to rapidly getting better as dataset size increases to eventually settling into irreducible error region explained by a combination of factors including imperfect data that cause imperfect generalization <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00409">2</a> *</p> </blockquote> <p>This can be attributed to several factors including imperfection in data. The importance of data quality and continually iterating over is touched on in some of the previous talks <a href="https://suneeta-mall.github.io/talks/She_Builds_on_AWS_2020.html">1</a>, <a href="https://suneeta-mall.github.io/talks/AWS_ANZ_Commuity_day_2020.html">2</a>, <a href="https://suneeta-mall.github.io/talks/Kafka_Summit_APAC_2021.html">3</a>. Data quality matters, and so does the data distribution. The better the distribution of the training dataset is, the more generalized the model can be!</p> <hr> <blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Data is certainly the new oil! <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/no-data-is-not-the-new-oil/">3</a></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> <hr> <p>So, can we scale the data size without many grievances? Keep in mind, 61% of AI practicing organizations already find data and data-related challenges as their top challenge <a href="https://pages.run.ai/hubfs/PDFs/2021-State-of-AI-Infrastructure-Survey.pdf">4</a>. If the challenges around procurement, storage, data quality, and distribution/demographic of the dataset has not subsumed you yet, this post focuses on yet another series of questioning. How can we train efficiently when data volume grows and the computation cost and turnaround time increase linearly with data growth? Then we begin asking how much of the data is superfluous, which examples are more impactful, and how do we find them? These are very important questions to ask given a recent survey <a href="https://pages.run.ai/hubfs/PDFs/2021-State-of-AI-Infrastructure-Survey.pdf">4</a> noted that about 40% of the organizations practicing AI already spend at least $1M per annum on GPUs and AI-related compute infrastructures. This should concern us all. Not every organization beyond the FAANG (and also, the one's assumed in FAANG but missed out on acronym!) and ones with big fat balance sheet will be able to leverage the gain by simply scaling the dataset. Besides, this should concern us all for environmental reasons and carbon emissions implications <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2020/06/17/deep-learnings-climate-change-problem/?sh=55d621d76b43">more details</a>. </p> <blockquote> <p>The carbon footprint of training a single AI is as much as 284 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent — five times the lifetime emissions of an average car <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2205779-creating-an-ai-can-be-five-times-worse-for-the-planet-than-a-car/">source</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>The utopian state of simply scaling training datasets and counting your blessings simply does not exist. The question then is, what are we doing about it? Unfortunately not a whole lot especially if you look at the excitement in the ML research community in utilizing gazillion GPU years to gain a minuscule increase in model performance attributed to algorithmic or architectural changes. But the good news is this area is gaining much more traction now. Few pieces of research since 2020 are very promising albeit in their infancy. I have been following the literature around the use of data in AI (a.k.a data-centric AI) topic very closely as this is one of my active areas of interest. I am excited about some of the recent developments in this area. In this post, I will cover some of my learnings and excitement around this topic.</p> <p>Before, covering them in detail, let's review foundational understanding and priors first:</p> <h2 id=labelled-data-the-types-of-labels><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#labelled-data-the-types-of-labels>Labelled data: the types of labels</a></h2> <p>This post focuses heavily on supervised learning scenarios focussing mainly on computer vision. In this space, there are two types of labels: - Hard labels - Soft labels</p> <p>Traditional labels are hard labels where the value of ground truth is a discrete value e.g. 0 and 1, 0 for no, and 1 for yes. These discrete values can be anything depending on how the dataset was curated. It's important to note that these values are absolute and unambiguously indicate their meaning.</p> <p>There is an emerging form of labels known as soft labels where ground through represents the likelihood. By nature these labels are continuous. An example, a pixel is 40% cat 60% dog. It will make a whole lot of sense in the following sections.</p> <h2 id=commonly-used-dl-techniques-centered-around-data><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#commonly-used-dl-techniques-centered-around-data>Commonly used DL techniques centered around data</a></h2> <p>Data augmentation and transfer learning are two commonly used techniques in deep learning these days that focus on applying data efficiently. Both these techniques are heavily democratized now and commonly applied unless explicitly omitted. </p> <h3 id=data-augmentation><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#data-augmentation>Data Augmentation</a></h3> <p>Data augmentation encompasses a variety of techniques to transform a datapoint such that it adds variety to the dataset. The technique aims to keep the data distribution about the same but add richness to the dataset by adding variety. Predominantly, the transformation via this technique has been intra-sample. Affine transformations, contrast adjustment, jittering, or color balancing are some such examples of data augmentation techniques. <a href="https://github.com/aleju/imgaug">Imgaug</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kornia/kornia">kornia</a> are very good libraries for such operation even though all ML frameworks offer a limited set of data augmentation routines. </p> <p>Data augmentation technique was initially proposed to increase robustness and achieve better generalization in the model but they are also used as a technique to synthetically increase data size as well. This is especially true in cases where data procurement is really challenging. These days, data augmentation techniques have become a lot more complex and richer including scenarios where-in model-driven augmentations may also be applied. One example of this is GAN-based techniques to augment and synthesize samples. In fact, data augmentation is also one of the techniques to build robustness against adversarial attacks.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/imgaug_heavy1.jpg> * Example of augmentation <a href="https://github.com/aleju/imgaug">src</a> *</p> </blockquote> <h3 id=transfer-learning><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#transfer-learning>Transfer Learning</a></h3> <p>Transfer learning is a very well democratized technique as well that stems from reusing the learned representations into a new task if the problem domain of two tasks is related. Transfer learning relaxes the assumption that the training data must be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with the test data <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01974">5</a>, allowing one to solve the problem of insufficient training data by bootstrapping model weights from another learned model trained with another dataset.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/transfer_learning.jpeg> *Figure 3: Training with and without transfer learning <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.146.1515&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">6</a> *</p> </blockquote> <p>With transfer learning, faster convergence can be achieved if there is an overlap between the tasks of the source and target model.</p> <h3 id=dimensionality-reduction><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#dimensionality-reduction>Dimensionality reduction</a></h3> <p>Dimension reduction techniques are also applied to large datasets:</p> <p>These techniques are categorized into two: 1. Ones that seek to preserve the pairwise distance amongst all the samples in the dataset. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a good example of this. 2. Ones that preserve the local distances over global distance. The techniques like uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426">23</a> and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf">24</a> fit in this category. UMAP arguably preserves more of the global structure and is algorithmically faster than t-sne. Both T-SNE and UMAP use gradient descent for arriving at the optimal embeddings.</p> <p>These techniques in DL space however are mostly used to understand the data and also for visualization purposes. UMAP and T-SNE do better at preserving global structure than other embedding algorithms but are limited. <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/tsne-vs-umap-global-structure-4d8045acba17">This blog</a> covers the topic more in detail.</p> <h3 id=active-learning><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#active-learning>Active learning</a></h3> <p>Active learning is a methodology wherein the training process proactively asks for labels on specific data. It is used more commonly in classical ML techniques, but it has not been very successful in deep learning due to back-propagation. Offline or pool-based active learning has been investigated heavily for use in deep learning but without much groundbreaking success. The use of active learning is not very straightforward either due to the negative impact of outliers on training <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02331">25</a>. Pool-based active learning will be covered in the following section in more detail (pruning).</p> <h2 id=challenges-in-scaling-dataset-for-deep-learning><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#challenges-in-scaling-dataset-for-deep-learning>Challenges in scaling dataset for deep-learning</a></h2> <p>Besides the techniques discussed in <a href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#commonly-used-dl-techniques-centered-around-data>previous section</a>, not a lot of investment has been done in the area focussing on data-centric AI. The momentum around data-centric AI is forming a bit recently with <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg">Andrew Ng</a> driving <a href="https://landing.ai/data-centric-ai/">data-centric AI</a> efforts through his new startup <a href="https://landing.ai">Landing.AI</a>. </p> <p>In my view, the following are some of the broad categories of questions that fall under the purview of data-centric AI:</p> <ol> <li>How to efficiently train with the rapid increase in the dataset? <a href="https://twitter.com/ylecun">Yann LeCun</a> called out in his interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/soumithchintala">Soumith Chintala</a> during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXbbaEZbrOI">PyTorch developer day 2021</a> that training time of more than 1 week should not be acceptable. This is a very good baseline for practical reasons but if one does not have an enormous GPU fleet at their disposal then this is goalpost is very hard to achieve given current DL practices. So, what else can be done to train efficiently with increased dataset size?</li> <li>Are all samples equally important? How important a sample in the dataset is? Can we leverage the "importance factor" for good?</li> <li>What role does a sample play towards better generalization? Some samples carry redundant features, so how to deduplicate the dataset when features as in DL are not explicit?</li> <li>Data size matters but can we be strategic about what goes in the dataset?<ol> <li>Cleverly doing this has to do with efficient sampling and data mining techniques. These are the easily solved problem if and only if we know what our targets are. Challenge in DL, as I see it, is what to look for to mine for the best sample?

Our system had evolved into efficient strategies to parse through infinite data streams to select the samples we are interested in. How our vision system performs foveal fixation utilizing saccadic eye movements to conduct efficient subsampling of interesting and useful datapoint should be a good motivation. Sure we fail sometimes, we fail to see the pen on the table even though it's right in front of us due to various reasons but we hit it right most of the time. Some concepts of <a href="http://www.gestalttheory.net/cms/uploads/pdf/archive/1934_1960/Principles_Gestalt_Psychology_koffka.pdf">Gestalt theory</a>, a principle used to explain how people perceive visual components (as organized patterns, instead of many disparate parts) are already applicable for better selection of data even if machine models are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">stochastic parrots</a>. According to this theory, eight main factors, listed below, determine how the visual system automatically groups elements into patterns. </p> <ol> <li>Proximity: Tendency to perceive objects or shapes that are close to one another as forming a group. </li> <li>Similarity: Tendency to group objects if physical resemblance e.g. shape, pattern, color, etc. is present. </li> <li>Closure: Tendency to see complete figures/forms even if what is present in the image is incomplete. </li> <li>Symmetry: Tendency to 'see' objects as symmetrical and forming around a center point. 50 </li> <li>Common fate: Tendency to associate similar movement as part of a common motion. </li> <li>Continuity: Tendency to perceive each object as a single uninterrupted i.e. continuous object </li> <li>Good Gestalt: Tendency to group together if a regular, simple, and orderly pattern can be formed </li> <li>Past experience: Tendency to categorize objects according to past experience. </li> </ol> <p>Of these, I argue, proximity, similarity, common fate, and past experience are relevant. I even argue on the possibility of applying closure. A recent work by FAIR <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377">22</a>, shows that machine models can fill in the gaps and infer missing pieces correctly by applying minor changes commonly used technique autoencoders. Why I bring this up with so much excitement than GAN-based techniques of hallucination is how easy it is to build and train as compared to GAN.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/masked_autoencoder.jpeg> <em>Masked-Autoencoders showing model inferring missing patches <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377">22</a></em></p> </blockquote> <p>Its been interesting to note that the recent advances towards dealing with the challenges of scaled data are largely inspired by already known deep-learning techniques except they are now applied through the lens of data.

Regularization</a></h3> <h4 id=11-mixup><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#11-mixup>1.1 Mixup</a></h4> <p>Mixup is a special form of data augmentation technique that looks beyond intra-sample modification and explores inter-sample modification. The idea with mixup is to linearly combine (through convex geometry) a pair of samples to result into one.</p> <p>$ \begin{equation} x\prime=λx_i + (1−λ)x_j , \ \text{where,} λ ∈ [0,1] \ \text{ drawn from beta distribution, and xi, xj are input/source vector} \end{equation} $</p> <p>$ \begin{equation} y\prime = λy_i + (1 − λ)y_j , \ \text{where y_i , yj are one-hot label encodings} \end{equation} $</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/mixup_on_oxford_pets.jpeg> *Figure 4: Sample produced by applying mixup <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412">7</a> on <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/">Oxford Pets dataset</a> *</p> </blockquote> <p>Mixup <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412">7</a> in fact seeks to regularize the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples. As shown in fig 5, mixup results in better models with fewer missed. Its been shown that mixup increases the generalization, reduces the memorization of corrupt labels, increases the robustness towards adversarial examples <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412">7</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187">8</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/mixup-gradnorm.jpeg> <em>Figure 5: Shows that using mixup <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412">7</a>, lower prediction error and smaller gradient norms are observed.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I see mixup as not only an augmentation, and regularisation technique but also a data compression technique. Depending on how frequently (say α) the mixup is applied, the dataset compression ratio (C<sub>r</sub>) will :</p> <p>$ \begin{equation} C_r = 1 - α/2 \end{equation} $</p> <p>If you have not noticed already, applying mixup convert labels to soft labels. The linear combination of discreet values will result in a continuous label value that can explain the example previously discussed wherein the pixel is 40% cat 60% dog (see fig 5).</p> <h4 id=12-label-smoothing><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#12-label-smoothing>1.2 Label Smoothing</a></h4> <p>Label smoothing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567">10</a> is a form of regularisation technique that smoothes out ground truth by a very small value epsilon <code>ɛ</code>. One motivation for this is of course better generalization and avoiding overfitting. While the other motivation is to discourage the model from becoming overconfident. Both <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187">8</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567">10</a> have shown that label smoothing leads to better models.</p> <p>$ \begin{equation} Q_{i} = \begin{cases} \displaystyle 1 - ɛ &amp; \text{if i == k,} \ <br> ɛ/K &amp; \text{Otherwise, where K is number of classes} \ <br> \end{cases} <br> \end{equation} $</p> <p>Label smoothing as indicated by the equation above does not lead to any visible differences in label data as <code>ɛ</code> is really small. However, applying mixup change visibly changes both source (x) and the label (y).</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/visible_ls.jpeg> <em>Applying label-smoothing has no noticeable difference</em></p> </blockquote> <h3 id=2-compression><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#2-compression>2. Compression</a></h3> <p>Compression refers to a broad range of data filtering and compression techniques to reduce size without compromising much on generalization. Following are some of the recent exciting development on this front:</p> <h4 id=21-x-shot-learning-how-many-are-enough><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#21-x-shot-learning-how-many-are-enough>2.1. X-shot learning: How many are enough?</a></h4> <p>The troubles of high computational cost and long training times due to an increase in the dataset have led to the development of training by a few shot strategies. The intuition behind this approach is to take a model and guide it to learn to perform a new task only by looking at a few samples <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05046">11</a>. The concept of transfer learning is implicitly applied in this approach. This line of investigation started with training new tasks by using only a few (handful) samples and explored an extreme case of one-shot training i.e. learning new tasks from only one sample <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1597116">12</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080">13</a>.</p> <p>Recently an interesting mega-extreme approach of shot-based learning has emerged - <code>'Less Than One'-Shot Learning</code> a.k.a LO Shot learning <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05046">11</a>. This approach utilizes soft label concepts and seeks to merge hard label N class samples into M samples where M &lt; N and thus the name less than one! LO Shot-based techniques are a form of data compression technique and may feel very similar to the MixUp technique discussed earlier. However, LO Shot contrary to a convex combination of samples as in Mixup, exploits distance weighted k-Nearest Neighbours technique to infer the soft labels. Their algorithm termed <code>distance-weighted soft-label prototype k-Nearest Neighbours (SLaPkNN)</code> essentially takes the sum of the label vectors of the k-nearest prototypes to target point x, with each prototype weighted inversely proportional to its distance from x. The following figure shows 4 class datasets are merged into 2 samples using SLaPkNN.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/LO-Shot.jpeg> <em>Figure LO-Shot: LO Shot splitting 4 class space into 2 points <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05046">11</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>In my understanding that is the main theoretical difference between the two techniques, with the other difference being mixup only merges two samples into one using a probability drawn from beta distribution combined using <code>λ</code> and <code>1-λ</code> whereas LO is more versatile and can compress greatly. I am not saying mixup cant be extended to be more multivariate but that empirical analysis of such approach is unknown; whereas with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05046">11</a> its been shown SLaPkNN can compress 3M − 2 classes into M samples at least. </p> <p>The technical explanation for this along with code is available <a href="https://github.com/ilia10000/LO-Shot/tree/master/Paper1">here</a>.</p> <h4 id=22-pruning><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#22-pruning>2.2. Pruning</a></h4> <p>Pruning is a subclass of compression techniques wherein samples that are not really helpful or effective are dropped out whereas selected samples are kept as is without any loss in content. Following are some of the known techniques of dataset pruning:</p> <h5 id=221-coresets><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#221-coresets>2.2.1 Coresets</a></h5> <p>Coreset selection technique pertains to subsampling from a large dataset to a smaller set that almost approximates the given large set. This is not a new technique and has heavily been explored using hand-engineered features and simpler models like Markov models to approximate the smaller set. This is not a DL-specific technique either and has its place in classical ML as well. An example could be using naïve Bayes to select coresets for more computationally expensive counterparts like decision trees. </p> <p>In deep learning, using a similar concept, a lighter-weight DL model can be used as a proxy to select the approximate dataset <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11829">15</a>. This is easier achieved when continual learning is practiced otherwise it can be a very expensive technique in itself given proxy model needs to be trained with a full dataset first. This becomes especially tricky given the proxy and target models are different and also when the information in the dataset is not concentrated in a few samples but uniformly distributed over all of them. These are some of the reasons why this approach is not very successful.</p> <h5 id=222-example-forgetting><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#222-example-forgetting>2.2.2 Example forgetting</a></h5> <p>An investigation <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05159">14</a> reported that some samples once learned are never forgotten and exhibit the same behavior across various training parameters and hyperparameters. There are other classes of samples that are forgotten. The forgetting event was defined as when the model prediction regresses in the subsequent epoch. Both qualitative and qualitative (see fig 6 and 7) analysis into such forgotten samples indicated noisy labels, images with "uncommon" visually complicated features were the main reasons for example forgetting.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt=w src=../resources/data-centric-ai/forgetting_stats.jpeg> <em>Figure 6: Algorithm to track forgotten samples <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05159">14</a>.</em></p> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/forgetten_samples.jpeg> <em>Figure 7: Indicating how increasing fraction of noisy samples led to increased forgetting events <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05159">14</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>An interesting observation from this study was that losing a large fraction of unforgotten samples still results in extremely competitive performance on the test set. The hypothesis formed was unforgotten samples are not very informative whereas forgotten samples are more informative and useful for training. In their case, the forgetting score stabilized after 75 epochs (using RESNET &amp; CIFAR but the value will vary as per model and data).</p> <p>Perhaps a few samples are enough to tell that a cat has 4 legs, a small face, and pointy ears, and it's more about how different varieties of cats look especially if they look different from the norm e.g. Sphynx cats.</p> <h5 id=223-using-gradient-norms><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#223-using-gradient-norms>2.2.3 Using Gradient norms</a></h5> <p>Loss functions are an excellent measure to find interesting samples in your dataset whether these may be poorly labeled or really outlier samples. This was highlighted by <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1311884485676294151">Andrej Karpathy</a> as well:</p> <blockquote> <p>When you sort your dataset descending by loss you are guaranteed to find something unexpected, strange, and helpful.</p> </blockquote> <p>Personally, I have found loss a very good measure to find poorly labeled samples. So, the natural question would be "should we explore how we can use the loss as a measure to prune the dataset?". It's not until NeurIPS 2021, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07075">21</a> that this was properly investigated. This Standford study looked into the initial loss gradient norm of individual training examples, averaged over several weight initializations, to prune the dataset for better generalization. This work is closely related to example forgetting except that instead of performance measure the focus more is on using local information early in training to prune the dataset. </p> <p>This work proposes GraNd score of a training sample (x, y) at time t given by L2 norm of the gradient of loss computed on that sample and also expected loss L2 norm termed EL2N (equation below). The reasoning here is that samples with a small GraNd score have abounded influence on learning how to classify the rest of the training data at a given training time. Empirically, this paper found that averaging the norms over multiple weight initializations resulted in scores that correlate with forgetting scores <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05159">14</a> and leads to pruning a significant fraction of samples early in training. They were able to prune 50% of the sample from <em>CIFAR-10 without affecting accuracy</em>, while on the more challenging CIFAR-100 dataset, they pruned 25% of examples with only a 1% drop in accuracy. <br> $ \begin{equation} χ_t(x, y) = E_{w_t} || g_t(x, y)||_2 \ \tag*{GraNd eq} \ \end{equation} $</p> <p>$ \begin{equation} χ_t(x, y) = E || p(w_t, x) - y)||_2 \ \tag*{EL2N eq} \ \end{equation} $</p> <p>This is a particularly interesting approach and is a big departure from other pruning strategies to date which treated samples in the dataset independently. Dropping samples based on independent statistics provides a weaker theoretical guarantee of success as DL is a non-convex problem <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07075">21</a>. I am very curious to find out how mixup impacts the GraNd scores given it shown (see figure 5b) using mixup leads to smaller gradient norm (l1 albeit).</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/gradnd_el2n.jpeg> <em>Results of prunning with GradNd and EL2N <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07075">21</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The results from this study are shown in the fig above. Noticeably high pruning is not fruititious even with this approach despite how well it's doing on CIFAR-10 and 100 datasets. Are we retaining the data distribution when we drop large samples? Mostly not and that is only reasoning that makes sense. And we circle back to how much pruning is enough? Is that network dependent or more a property of data and its distribution? This study <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07075">21</a> claims that GradND and EL2N scores, when averaged over multiple initializations or training trajectories remove dependence on specific weights/networks, presenting a more compressed dataset. If this assertion holds in reality, in my view, this is a very promising finding easing the data-related challenges of DL.</p> <p>What's more fascinating about this work is that it sheds light on how the underlying data distribution shapes the training dynamics. This has been amiss until now. Of particular interest is identifying subspaces of the model's data representation that are relatively stable over the training.</p> <h4 id=23-distillation><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#23-distillation>2.3. Distillation</a></h4> <p>Distillation technique refers to the methodologies of distilling the knowledge of a complex or larger set into a smaller set. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531">Knowledge or model distillation</a> is a popular technique that compresses the learned representation of a larger model into a much smaller model without any significant drop in performance. Using student-teacher training regime have been explored extensively even in the case of transformer networks that are even more data-hungry than more conventional network say Convolution network <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877">DeiT</a>. Despite being called data-efficient, this paper employs a teacher-student strategy to transform networks, and data itself is merely treated as a commodity. </p> <p>Recently, this concept is investigated for use in deep learning for dataset distillation with aim of synthesizing an optimal smaller dataset from a large dataset <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10959">17</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08259">16</a>. The distilled dataset are learned and synthesized but in theory, they approximate the larger dataset. Note that the synthesized data may not follow the same data distribution.</p> <p>Some dataset distillation techniques refer to their approach as compression as well. I disagree with this in principle as compression albeit lossy in this context, refers to compressing the dataset whereas with distillation the data representation is deduced/synthesized - potentially leading to entirely different samples together. Perhaps it's the compressibility factor a.k.a compression ratio that applies to both techniques. For example, see figure 13 shows the extent to which distilled images can change.</p> <p>A dataset distillation <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10959">17</a> paper quotes:</p> <blockquote> <p>We present a new optimization algorithm for synthesizing a small number of synthetic data samples not only capturing much of the original training data but also tailored explicitly for fast model training in only a few gradient steps <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10959">17</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Their problem formulation was very interesting! they derive the network weights as a differentiable function of the synthetic training data and set the training objective to optimize the pixel values of the distilled images The result from this study showed that one can go as low as one synthetic image per category while not regressing too much on the performance. More concretely, they distilled 60K training images of the MNIST digit dataset into only 10 synthetic images (one per class) yields a test-time MNIST recognition performance of 94%, compared to 99% for the original dataset). </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/fair_mnist_distillation.jpeg> <em>Figure 8: Dataset distillation results from FAIR study <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10959">17</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Here are some of the distilled samples for the classes labeled at the top (fig 9). It's amazing how well the MNIST trained on these sets does but CIFAR one misses the mark only being about as good as random (54%) compared to 80% on the full dataset(fig 8 &amp; 9).</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/example_of_distilled_images.jpeg> <em>Figure 9: Dataset distillation results from FAIR study <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10959">17</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Following this work, another distillation technique was proposed utilizing kernel methods - more specifically kernel ridge regression to obtain ε-approximate of original datasets <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00050">18</a>. This technique is termed Kernel Inducing Points (KIP) and follows the same principle for keeping the objective function to maximize the approximation and backpropagate the gradients to learn synthesized distilled data. The difference between <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00050">18</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10959">17</a> is one <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10959">17</a> uses the same DL network while the other <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00050">18</a> uses kernel techniques. With KIP, another advantage is that not just source samples but optionally labels can be synthesized too. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10959">17</a>, the objective was purely to learn pixel values and thus the source (X). This paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00050">18</a> also proposes another technique Label Solve (LS) in while X is kept constant and only label (Y) is learned.</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/KIP_LS.jpeg> <em>Figure 10: Examples of distilled samples a) with KIP and b) With LS <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00050">18</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The CIFAR 10 result from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10959">17</a> (fig 9) was about 36.79% for 10 samples, with KIP there is a slight gain in performance there given the extreme compression. This raises the question of what is a good compression ratio that can guarantee good information retention. For complex tasks like CIFAR (compared to MNIST), 10 (one per sample) may not be enough given how complex this dataset is comparatively. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/KIP_LS_Results.jpeg> <em>Figure 11: CIFAR10 result from KIP and LS <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00050">18</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Actually, LO shot technique <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05046">11</a>, discussed previously, is also a specialized form of X-shot technique that does dataset distillation. Aside from that, gradient-based techniques for dataset distillation have been actively investigated in the last few years (ref <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08259">16</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10959">17</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00050">18</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05929">19</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13034">20</a>). Another approach explored siamese augmentation method termed <code>Differentiable Siamese Augmentation (DSA)</code> that uses matching loss and synthesizes dataset through backpropagation techniques <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08259">16</a></p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/dsa.jpeg> <em>Figure 12: Differentiable Siamese Augmentation <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08259">16</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Bayesian and gradient-descent trained neural networks converge to Gaussian processes (GP) as the number of hidden units in intermediary layers approaches infinity <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13034">20</a> (fig 13). This is true for convolutional networks as well as they converge to a particular gaussian processes channel limits are stretched to infinity. These networks can thus be described as kernels known as Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). <a href="https://github.com/google/neural-tangents">Neural Tangents</a> library based on <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">JAX</a> an auto differentiation toolkit has been used in applying these kernels in defining some of the recent distillation methods.

The distillation results are curious, to say the least. In the example, the distilled apple image seems to represent a pile of apples whereas the bottle distilled results into visibly different bottles while still showing artifacts of the original two bottles. While other classes show high order features (with some noise). </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/example_kip_infinite_width_kernel.jpeg> <em>Figure 15: KIP ConvNet example of distilled CIFAR set <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13034">20</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Figure 16 shows MNIST results, they are not only very interesting but also look very much like mixup (where x and y both are mixed).</p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/KIP_Infi_MNIST.jpeg> <em>Figure 16: KIP ConvNet example of distilled MNIST set <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13034">20</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <h3 id=3-so-what-if-you-have-noisy-data><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#3-so-what-if-you-have-noisy-data>3. So what if you have noisy data</a></h3> <p>Noises in the dataset are considered a nuisance. Because models hold the compressed form of knowledge represented by the dataset, dataset curation techniques carefully look to avoid noises in datasets. </p> <p>Noises can be an incredibly powerful technique to fill in the missing information in source/images. For instance, if only part of an image is known then instead of padding the image with default (0 or 1-pixel value), filling in using random noise can be an effective technique avoiding confusion on actual real values that relate to the black or white region. This has held true in my own experience. It was very amusing to note that the forgetting event study <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05159">14</a> in fact looked into adding label noise on the distribution of forgetting events. They added noise in pixel values and observed that adding an increasing amount of noise decreases the number of unforgettable samples (see also figure 7 for their results when noise was used). </p> <p>Noise coming from randomness is handled very well by DL networks as well. I find the result from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377">22</a>, shown in figure 17 quite fascinating actually. Looking at how well the model is doing when missing patches are random and how poor it is doing when missing patches are systematic is indicative of how powerful and lame (both at the same time) machines are! </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/data-centric-ai/masked_autoencoder_noisy_patches.jpeg> <em>Figure 17: Noisy patches in Masked-AutoEncoder <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377">22</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>GradND study <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07075">21</a>, looked into the effect of noise on the source itself and performed a series of experiments to conclude that when there is enough data, keeping the high score examples, which are often noisy or difficult, does not hurt performance and can only help.</p> <h2 id=conclusion><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#conclusion>Conclusion</a></h2> <p>In summary, the last four years have been incredibly exciting for data in DL space and the year 2021 even more! There is a lot of mileage we can get out of simpler techniques like MixUp but more exciting developments are dissecting the training dynamics and exploring the importance of samples in solving a particular task using DL techniques. Distillation methods are still in the early stages where they work well for simpler datasets but honestly how many real-world problems have simple datasets? Nevertheless, some really exciting development in this space. These techniques can be groundbreaking if the compression methods hold across a wide range of architectures as indicated by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07075">21</a>. </p> <h2 id=references><a class=toclink href=2021/12/31/data-in-deep-learning/#references>References</a></h2> <ol> <li>[1707.02968] Revisiting Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data in Deep Learning Era.” Accessed January 3, 2022. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02968">https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02968</a>.</li> <li>Hestness, Joel, Sharan Narang, Newsha Ardalani, Gregory Diamos, Heewoo Jun, Hassan Kianinejad, Md Mostofa Ali Patwary, Yang Yang, and Yanqi Zhou. “Deep Learning Scaling Is Predictable, Empirically,” December 2017. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00409">https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00409</a>.</li> <li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/no-data-is-not-the-new-oil/">https://www.wired.com/story/no-data-is-not-the-new-oil/</a></li> <li><a href="https://pages.run.ai/hubfs/PDFs/2021-State-of-AI-Infrastructure-Survey.pdf">https://pages.run.ai/hubfs/PDFs/2021-State-of-AI-Infrastructure-Survey.pdf</a></li> <li>[1808.01974] A Survey on Deep Transfer Learning.

Who killed my pod - Whodunit?</a></h2> <p>A few days ago, I deployed a brand new application onto a self-managed Kubernetes cluster (hereafter referred to as Kube). Suffice to say, all hell broke loose. The pods were getting <code>OOMKilled</code> with error code 137 left and right! </p> <p>Now, I know a thing or two about Kubernetes<sup><a href="https://suneeta-mall.github.io/talks/KubernetesSydneyForum_AU_2019.html">1</a>,<a href="https://suneeta-mall.github.io/talks/KubeCon_US_2019.html">2</a></sup>. I am not a total Kube noob!<br> But, I could not figure out what the fudge was going on actually! Besides, this app has been thoroughly tested and profiled and ran fine on bare metal and virtual environments.</p> <p>So this was me, a few days ago!.</p> <!-- ![](../../resources/oom/4201968f94aacab1c0190d9688daba00-sticker.jpg)--> <p><img alt= src="../assets/external/media4.giphy.com/media/z9AUvhAEiXOqA/giphy-downsized.gif"></p> <p>This sparked a massive hunt for the culprit, and some interesting insights were discovered. Worth noting, similar investigating has also been done on by <a href="https://engineering.linecorp.com/en/blog/prometheus-container-kubernetes-cluster/">Line Corp</a> in their excellent blog however, I have a different story to tell!</p> <p>In this writeup, I am going to talk about this particular incident and the insights I have uncovered about both Kube and Linux kernels.</p> <h3 id=context-of-the-app><a class=toclink href=2021/03/14/wth-who-killed-my-pod---whodunit/#context-of-the-app>Context of the app</a></h3> <p>The app runs some intensive <a href="https://numpy.org">numpy</a> and <a href="https://tensorflow.org">Tensorflow</a> computations to produce some artifacts and associative metadata. The workloads are more memory-intensive as they operate on rich multi-media content. Other gory details besides <em>resource requirements</em> of the app is irrelevant for this discussion. </p> <p>The average resource requirement, for this app, is very fluctuating yet predictable (in a given range). At least so we thought looking at our metrics:</p> <p><img alt src=../resources/oom/avg-resource-requirement.jpg> <em>Figure 2: Average resource requirements of the app when run on VMs or bare metal</em></p> <p>I hear you, the resource utilization is not following a zero gradient line (fig 2)! It would be awesome to have constant non-flapping resource requirement needs - so clearly some work needs to happen on the app here. Having said that, it's an absolutely acceptable and supported workload. </p> <p>Ok, so the app was deployed and now, we will look at the line of investigation:</p> <h3 id=apps-on-kube-day-1><a class=toclink href=2021/03/14/wth-who-killed-my-pod---whodunit/#apps-on-kube-day-1>App's on Kube: day 1</a></h3> <p>The provisioned app pods started to get killed as frequently as every 20 mins or more with error code 137 and reason <code>OOMKilled</code>. </p> <p><img alt src=../resources/oom/Joys%20of%20being%20killed%21.jpg> <em>Figure 3: The killer is on the loose! - Whodunit?</em></p> <p>Let me explain a few things about the failure first: 1. <code>Error code 137</code> indicates that the container process received the SIGKILL and thus was killed by the OS kernel. SIGKILL on Kube can only be produced using one of the following means:</p> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>1.1. Manually (human): Triggering CTRL+C or using other means of manually sending SIGKILL or even manually killing process.

1.2. Container Runtime/Interface: `Kubelet` the process running on the host machine that manages running Kube workload is `the power that be` for containers. 
It communicates through container runtime to manage the container lifecycle. It can kill and almost always kills badly behaving pods!

1.3. OS kernel: The OS kernel is responsible for the life cycle of processes running on the host. 
It is `the mighty power that be` for all the processes on the host including the container process and its children.
It can also kill and almost always kills badly behaving processes!

It provides ability to run containers.</p> <p>b) Image management: How images are packed, unpacked, pushed, pulled etc comes under this umbrella. A good example for this is "containerd". </p> <p><img alt src=../resources/oom/docker_stack.jpeg> <em>Figure 5: Docker stack!

Note <code>kubelet</code> is a service running on the host and it operates at the host level, not the pod. With <code>cAdvisor</code> it captures resource utilization, statistics about <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html">control group</a> of all container processes on the host.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kubernetes manages the resource for containers using <code>cgroups</code> that guarantees resource isolation and restrictions. Kube can allocate X amount of ../resources to a container and allow the ../resources to grow until a pre-existing limit is reached or no more is left on the host to use. Kube provides these <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-../resources-containers/">requests and limits</a> semantic on containers which are used to enforce the said limit on process hierarchy for each container via cgroups. Now, the `limit is not always a hard cut-off. As documented in google's blog of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubernetes-best-practices-resource-requests-and-limits">best practices resource requests and limits</a>, there are two types of ../resources:</p> <ol> <li><em>Compressible</em> ../resources: When resource limit is reached, Kube will throttle the container i.e. start to restrict the usage but won't actually terminate the container. CPU is considered as a compressible resource.</li> <li><em>Incompressible</em> ../resources: When a limit for this type of resource is reached, the highest usage process within the cgroups hierarchy will be killed. Memory is an incompressible resource. </li> </ol> <p><code>Takeaway 2</code>: It's not the CPU limit, but the memory limit that we need to focus on.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kubernetes classifies pod into three categories based on the quality of service (QoS) they provide:</p> <p>4.1 <em>Guaranteed</em> pods are those who's resource request and limit are just the same. These are the best kind of workload from Kube's viewpoint as they are easier to allocate and plan for resource-wise. These pods are guaranteed to not be killed until they exceed their limits. <img alt src=../resources/oom/qos-guranteed.jpg> <em>Figure 7: Guaranteed QoS pod example</em></p> <p>4.2 <em>Best-Effort</em> pods are those where no resource requirements are specified. These are the lowest priority pods and the first to get killed if the system runs out of memory. <img alt src=../resources/oom/qos-best%20effort.jpg> <em>Figure 8: Best-Effort QoS pod example</em></p> <p>4.3 <em>Burstable</em> pods are those whose resource request and limit are defined in a range (fig 9), with limit treated as max if undefined. These are the kind of workloads that are more likely to be killed when the host system is under load and they exceed their requests and no Best-Effort pods exist. <img alt src=../resources/oom/qos-bustable.jpg> <em>Figure 9: Burstable QoS pod example</em></p> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>So can Kube over-commit? 
If yes, would it always be on the compressible ../resources? 
</code></pre></div> <p>Yes, Kube can overcommit. The pod limits are allowed to be higher than requests. It's possible that the sum of all limits exceeds the total node capacity. It's possible to overcommit both compressible and incompressible ../resources. This is pictorially explained <a href="https://sysdig.com/blog/troubleshoot-kubernetes-oom/">here</a>. In fact, with Kube, it's also possible to not only vertically overcommit but also horizontally (at cluster level) overcommit. Horizontal overcommits are nicer as they can trigger auto-scaling events to scale out. </p> </li> </ol> <h4 id=so-why-the-pods-are-getting-killed><a class=toclink href=2021/03/14/wth-who-killed-my-pod---whodunit/#so-why-the-pods-are-getting-killed>So why the pods are getting killed?</a></h4> <p>The app was initially deployed with <code>Burstable</code> QoS with Memory requirements set at request: 4Gi, limit: 7Gi, and CPU set at 2 for both requests, limits (see fig 2). The nodes were AWS <code>r5.2xlarge</code> type with 8 CPU, 64GB RAM, running Debian/Linux. Other than Kube system components and the app, nothing else was deployed on these nodes. </p> <p>So, Kube could have only deployed 3 app pods per <code>r5.2xlarge</code> nodes (due to CPU request). This means, 43GB (=64-7*3) of RAM was lying around singing hakuna matata! What a waste! Sure but let's not digress! So why the OOMKill? <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p> <p>Noteworthy observation: - Node monitoring tells us that is running healthy and has plenty of ../resources at its disposal. - the pod is still OOMKilled but not all app pods on the node, just one is killed.</p> <p>I am still clueless. So, caving in, I decided to use up this extra memory floating around and beef up the nodes a bit more and buy more time to do a proper investigation. Now, the apps are redeployed again with RAM request 4Gi, limit: 31Gi (leaving 4GB for other misc system components).</p> <p>Did that ameliorate the problem - no! Of course, I am being silly about this, I should be making it guaranteed to have better chance of avoiding OOMKill. </p> <h3 id=apps-on-kube-day-2><a class=toclink href=2021/03/14/wth-who-killed-my-pod---whodunit/#apps-on-kube-day-2>App's on Kube: day 2</a></h3> <p>So, my apps are running with guaranteed QoS with 31GB of RAM as required/limit. Node still seems healthy and shows no sign of duress. </p> <p>Hows the app doing with the new revised configuration: <code>still getting OOMKilled with 137 error code left and right!</code> </p> <p><img alt src=../resources/oom/34b8525b2cff89f7f25f2f70d62c5014-sticker.png></p> <p>Meanwhile, we uncovered random memory surges in some pods (see figure 10). These surges occurred very rarely and did not match to the duration of out-of-memory kill events. In fact, the frequency of OOM was much higher than these memory surges. </p> <p><img alt src=../resources/oom/memory-spike.jpg> <em>Figure 10: The notorious spike of memory use on pod</em></p> <p>While these surges are worth investigating, they are still within the request/limit range (28.x Gi suurge on 31Gi request). So they still don't justify the OOM event.</p> <h4 id=whats-log-telling-us><a class=toclink href=2021/03/14/wth-who-killed-my-pod---whodunit/#whats-log-telling-us>Whats log telling us</a></h4> <p>Based on Takeaway 1 &amp; 2, we look at who is firing the kill signal. #Whodunit</p> <h5 id=kube-events-for-pod-and-other-higher-level-abstractions><a class=toclink href=2021/03/14/wth-who-killed-my-pod---whodunit/#kube-events-for-pod-and-other-higher-level-abstractions>Kube events for pod and other higher-level abstractions</a></h5> <p>Investigating, on Kube <code>Events</code> there is no record or any OOMKill or any event signaling anything malicious. <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>kubectl<span class=w> </span>describe<span class=w> </span>pod<span class=w> </span>&lt;my<span class=w> </span>pod&gt;

Also, providing a limit on the swap is unsupported at the docker level which can lead to resource management and overcommitment chaos. These are some of the reasons why <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/3251">kops</a> and in general Kube prefer no swap on hosts. </p> <ol> <li><strong>OOMKill disable on Kubernetes</strong></li> </ol> <p>OS Kernels allow disabling OOM Kill for cgroups level (<code>/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.oom_control</code>) even docker supports it using <code>--oom-kill-disable</code> flag. These are highly discouraged due to the nature of problem band-aid fixer <code>OOM Killer</code> solves. It also does not sit with Kube's declarative approach orchestration and also with cattle workload philosophy. It's also why by default oom kill is enabled on Kubernetes.</p> <p>Its possible however to configure it to disable OOMKill by starting kubelet service with <code>--cgroup-driver=cgroupfs</code> argument and then setting <code>oom_kill_disable</code> under <code>/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.oom_control</code> as 1.</p> <p><code>Takeaway 5</code>: It's not something I want to enable either, but for the completeness of the discussion, it's worth mentioning :). </p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Kernel memory management</strong></p> <p>The kernel uses virtual addressing (using paging and segmentation) to provide isolation amongst various processes running on host. It is also virtual addressing that allows for use of more memory than what's available currently in physical memory (RAM) by making use of other sources like a disk (a.k.a. swap). Virtual addressing is divided into user &amp; kernel space. Userspace is the sort of virtual address space that's reserved for user/application programs whereas kernel space is reserved for kernel-related operations. </p> <p>Now, the os kernel is designed to be greedy - greedy to be able to run as many processes as possible. This is also the reason why we need mechanisms like `out of memory'.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>System vs memory controller (memch) OOM</strong></p> </li> </ol> <p>cgroups comprises of two components: <code>core</code> and <code>controller</code>. Core corresponds to managing the hierarchy and core capabilities whereas controllers are focused on the type of resource cgroup is controlling eg cpu, io, memory controller ('memcg'). </p> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>Now, the user-space out-of-memory handling can address OOM conditions for both cgroups using the memory controller (&#39;memcg&#39;) and for the system as a whole.
`Takeaway 6`: We know, based on our takeaways, that our OOM is not stemming from system draining or system as whole. Also, log `Memory cgroup out of memory` indicating that its `memcg`
that&#39;s triggering the OOM Kill. Here, the app process hierarchy memory usage is aggregated together into its memcgs so the memory usage at group level can be accounted for. 
What our first log here is telling us is `memcg usage reached its limits and memory cannot be reclaimed i.e. the memcg is out of memory`&lt;sup&gt;[1][lwn]&lt;/sup&gt;.
</code></pre></div> <ol> <li> <p><strong>OOM kill score</strong></p> <p>How does kernel come to decide which process to kill, is based on a score. The score has two parts: main (<code>oom_score</code>) and adjustment factor (<code>oom_score_adj</code>). These scores are store against process id in process space and can be located on disk as : <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/oom_score
/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/oom_score_adj
</code></pre></div></p> <p>The <code>oom_score</code> is given by kernel and is proportional to the amount of memory used by the process i.e. = 10 x percentage of memory used by the process. This means, the maximum <code>oom_score</code> is 100% x 10 = 1000!. Now, the higher the oom_score higher the change of the process being killed. However, user can provide an adjustment factor <code>oom_score_adj (a.k.a. oom_adj in older kernel versions)</code>. If provided, it is used to adjust the final score. The valid value for <code>oom_score_adj</code> is in the range of (-1000, +1000), where -ve score decreases and +ve increases the chances of oomkill. More details on this can be found in this very interesting article by Jonathan Corbet <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/391222/">another OOMKill rewrite</a>, with precursory article found <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/317814/">here</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>OOM trigger workflow</strong></p> </li> </ol> <p><code>kmsg</code> is the kernel message interface that directs kernel messages to <code>/proc/kmsg</code> &amp; <code>/dev/kmsg</code>. Now, <code>/dev/kmsg</code> is more useful for us mere mortals as it's designed to be persistent. <code>/proc/kmsg</code> is designed to be read once and treated more as event queue if you will. Messages from here also trickle through to kernel logs @ <code>/var/log/kern.log</code>.</p> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>_On Kube_

Kebelet watches for `kmsg` and handles messages that will translate to OOMEvent/OOMKillEvent in Kube event stream which is then handled appropriately to trigger OOMKill. More interesting details of how this happens can be found [here][line-eng-qos] (also shown in borrowed fig 11).

As mentioned in `takeway 3 &amp; 4`, this workflow however was not triggered in our case, we are did not record any Kube related OOM events or even kubelet receiving
any related messages.

_At Kernel Level_
When system or memory controller related OOM is suspected, based on `oom_score` (with adjustment `oom_score_adj`), `oom-killer` is invoked on the highest
score process and its children.

For more info, I will direct you to an excellent article by <a href="https://twitter.com/IanMLewis">Ian Lewis</a>, the <a href="https://www.ianlewis.org/en/almighty-pause-container">almighty pause container</a>.

Anon memory is used by programs to allocate memory for the stacks and heaps. Also, the standard page size on the Linux kernel is 4KB which can be really inefficient to store mapping for a large block of memory virtual memory. <code>Hugepages</code> are designed to solve this inefficiency and can hold a bigger chunk than 4KB.

</code></pre></div> <p>Now, as discussed previously, the swap is not being used in this system. See the second part of the logs in fig 13. You will note, there are two containers recorded and their memory stats is a capture - a) the pause container and b) the app container. We can ignore the pause, it's tiny and looking very healthy. But look at the stats for app pod in fig 13 (below)! At the time my app was killed, it held about 29GB in hugepages and only 1.3GB extra in RSS. That's huge and remember monitoring it not picking it for some reason! It captured 29GB but not 31GB! Perhaps its picking only <code>rss_huge</code> and presenting it as <code>rss</code> erroneously! <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>! Yes, we have a problem but this monitoring issue is for another day!</p> <p><img alt src=../resources/oom/log-part-2.jpg> <em>Figure 13: Kernel log part 2</em></p> <p>Notice the blue arrow in fig 13, its capturing page info by both the pause container process and app container process. These are page info and not and need to be multiplied by 4KB to get actual memory stats. These are translated two lines below the blue line! </p> <p>My app has freaking <strong><em>62GB</em></strong> in total virtual memory! What's going on! <img alt src=../resources/oom/wth.gif></p> <p>Ok, so "total-vm" is the part of virtual memory the process uses. A part of this "total-vm" that's mapped to RAM is <code>rss</code>. Part of <code>rss</code> that's allocated on to real memory, blocks is your <code>anon-rss</code> (anonymous memory), and the other part of rss is mapped to devices and files and termed <code>file-rss</code>. If my app goes crazy and allocates a large chunk of space (say using malloc()) but never really use it then <code>total-vm</code> can be high but it won't all be used in real memory. This is made possible due to overcommit. A good sign of this happening, given swap off, is when <code>total-vm</code> is high but <code>rss</code> is actually low! This is exactly what's happening here! We have about <strong>30GB</strong> difference between <code>total-vm</code> and <code>rss</code>.</p> <p><code>Takeaway 7</code>: We have two problems here: a) Supporting over-commitment and b) Allocation of what we suspect un-needed memory! </p> <p>Let's look at solving the over-commit first and see what level of fixes it provides:</p> <h4 id=controlling-over-commits><a class=toclink href=2021/03/14/wth-who-killed-my-pod---whodunit/#controlling-over-commits>Controlling over-commits</a></h4> <p>So far, we have concluded over-commitment is a problem. Well, as discussed previously, it's a feature (of both kernel &amp; kube) apparently!</p> <p><img alt= src="../assets/external/memecreator.org/static/images/memes/4777431.jpg"></p> <p>Kernel uses the "extendability" of virtual addressing to over-commit. The kernel settings <code>vm.overcommit_memory</code> and <code>vm.overcommit_ratio</code> is specially designed to controlling this capability. For more info, see <a href="https://engineering.pivotal.io/post/virtual_memory_settings_in_linux_-_the_problem_with_overcommit/">here</a>.</p> <p>1.1 <code>vm.overcommit_memory = 0</code>: Make best guess and overcommit where possible. This is the default.</p> <p>1.2 <code>vm.overcommit_memory = 1</code>: Always overcommit </p> <p>1.3 <code>vm.overcommit_memory = 2</code>: Never overcommit, and only allocate as much memory as defined in overcommit_ratio.</p> <p><code>vm.overcommit_ratio</code> is only used when overcommit_memory=2. It defines what percent of the physical RAM plus swap space should be allocated. This is default to 50. We want this config to be 100. </p> <p>But the use of <code>sysctl</code> to set these(using the following) is not enough as the config won't persist on horizontal scaling (new node spinning due to spot instances or less important but restart): <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>sysctl<span class=w> </span>-w<span class=w> </span>vm.overcommit_memory<span class=o>=</span><span class=m>2</span>

</code></pre></div> The effect of these configs is immediate and no start is needed. Talking about the restart, <code>systcl</code> cli config update do not persist, system config needs to be updated in <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> to persist the setting across restarts. </p> <p>On <code>Kube</code>, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/3251">kops</a> provisioned clusters, these settings need to be supplied through <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/cluster_spec.md#sysctlparameters">sysctlparameters</a> config but these are only supported from kube 1.17 and higher!

Also, 100% reproducible ML code comes at a cost of speed - a non-negotiable aspect in today's time. If we cannot be 100% and change is evident, then the only way to maintaining explainability, understanding, trust &amp; confidence is through version control everything. </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/git_2x.png> <em>Figure 1: Version control explained by <a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/">XKCD</a></em></p> </blockquote> <p>In this post, we will be looking at building an end to end fully automated ML pipeline that can maintain full provenance across the entire ML system. In my view, a standard machine learning workflow looks like the one below: </p> <blockquote> <p><img alt src=../resources/ai-workflow.jpg> <em>Figure 2: Machine Learning end to end system</em></p> </blockquote> <p>So we will be working towards building this system with full provenance over it. For this, we will be extending <a href="https://github.com/suneeta-mall/e2e-ml-on-k8s">our sample semantic segmentation example</a> based on <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/">Oxford Pet dataset</a> </p> <p>To build this ML workflow, we will be using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> - a container orchestration platform. On top of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, we will be running <a href="https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm">Pachyderm</a> software that will do the heavy lifting of maintaining provenance across data, artifacts, and ml processes.</p> <h3 id=what-to-version-control><a class=toclink href=2019/12/23/end-to-end-reproducible-machine-learning-pipelines-on-kubernetes/#what-to-version-control>What to version control</a></h3> <p>In <a href=/2019/12/21/Reproducible-ml-research-n-industry.html>part 1</a> of this blog series, we discussed above the challenges, shown in figure 3, in realizing reproducible ML.</p> <p><img alt src=../resources/reproducible-challenge.jpeg> <em>Figure 3: Overview of challenges in reproducible ML</em></p> <p>The presence of these challenges in the system-wide view of ML is shown in figure 4.</p> <p><img alt src=../resources/what-t--vcs.jpg> <em>Figure 4: What to version control?</em></p> <p>But first, let's talk about creating the environment, infrastructure, and versioning it. </p> <h4 id=1-versioning-environment><a class=toclink href=2019/12/23/end-to-end-reproducible-machine-learning-pipelines-on-kubernetes/#1-versioning-environment>1.

In this sample, we will be using <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/">ArgoCD</a> to implement GitOps workflow (figure 5) which will see our environment config moved to be alongside the code repository (figure 6). </p> <p><img alt src=../resources/gitops.png> <em>Figure 5: Gitops</em></p> <p>This is achieved by defining <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneeta-mall/e2e-ml-on-k8s/master/cluster-conf/e2e-ml-argocd-app.yaml">argo apps</a> which can be applied on BYO Kubernetes cluster (version 1.14.7) that has ArgoCD installed:</p> <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><code>kubectl<span class=w> </span>apply<span class=w> </span>–f<span class=w> </span>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneeta-mall/e2e-ml-on-k8s/master/cluster-conf/e2e-ml-argocd-app.yaml
</code></pre></div> <p><img alt src=../resources/env-as-code.jpg> <em>Figure 6: Gitops on environment config</em></p> <p>Once the Argo apps are created, the following software will be installed on the cluster: - Kubernetes: 1.14.7 (tested on this version, in theory, should work with other versions too!) - ArgoCD: 1.2.3 - Kubeflow: 0.6.2</p> <blockquote> <p>Kubeflow is an ML toolkit designed to bring a variety of ML related <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a> based software together. - Seldon 0.4.1 (upgraded from packaged version on kubeflow 0.6.2) Seldon is a model serving software - Pachyderm: 1.9.7 Pachyderm offers a git like a repository that can hold data even big data. It also offers automated repository capability that <code>act</code> on input and generate data thus holding a versioned copy of this generated data. Together with these constructs, it can be used to create pipeline DAG like processes with provenance across graph input, transformation spec, output</p> </blockquote> <p>Any change on this configuration repository will then trigger a cluster update keeping environment in synced with versioned config. </p> <h4 id=2-versioning-data-process-and-artifacts><a class=toclink href=2019/12/23/end-to-end-reproducible-machine-learning-pipelines-on-kubernetes/#2-versioning-data-process-and-artifacts>2.
